	<a href="topfield/pacman.zip" target="_blank">Pacman (Namco 1980):</a>
	Pacman probably is the most famous and successful video game in
	history. The arcade original was an instant hit in 1980, and
	since then up to modern times the game was ported to practically
	every hardware platform.<br>

	Pacman was developed by Namco. It used Zilog's legendary Z80 CPU
	and had custom video and sound hardware.

	<a href="topfield/invaders.zip" target="_blank">Space Invaders (Taito/Midway 1978):</a>
	Space Invaders is one of the great classic video games. In 1978, when it came out,
	it created the video game hype and was extremely successful in the arcades all over the world. 

	Space Invaders was made by Taito and licensed by Midway for the U.S. market.
	It used Intel's 8080 as its CPU	and had custom-made bitmapped video hardware.
	This video hardware could only generate black and white screen output. A transparent
	screen overlay colored certain areas in green and red.

	The arcade game Astro Fighter was originally written by Data East Corporation (DECO) in 1980.
	It was one of the first arcade games I ever played, though the version
	we had in our pub was called Astro Wars (bootlegged or made under license by
	the company Zaccaria).
