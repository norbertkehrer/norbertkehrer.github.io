<h2>Hewlett-Packard 45 Calculator in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h2>


	The Hewlett-Packard 45 is a great scientific calculator. It was introduced in 1973
	and was HP's second scientific calculator.
	<p>
	This JavaScript version was created more than 40 years later by the method of static binary translation.
	That means, that the calculator's program code originally written in the machine language of HP's special 4-bit CPU
	used in the HP-45 was converted one-to-one to JavaScript.
	The translation was automized by a JavaScript program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each CPU instruction. The outcome is an exact simulation of the original HP-45 calculator.
