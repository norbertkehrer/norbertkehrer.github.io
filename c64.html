<h2>Programs for the Commodore 64</h2>



	<h3>My C64 Programs from the Eighties</h3>
	My first own computer was a Commodore 64. I bought it in June 1984 together with a Datasette
	and a joystick and did a lot of programming on it from the beginning. Now I managed to transfer
	two of my old C64 programs to the PC with a self-built XE1541 cable.
	<p>
	You can download them with the following links and try them on an emulator or (better) transfer
	them to a real C64 to play them on the actual hardware they were written for.
	<p>
	<list>
	<li>
	<a href="c64/snake.zip">Snake</a> ... A Nibbler-like game I wrote in 1988.

	<li>
	<a href="c64/tetris.zip">Tetris</a> ... A Tetris version for the C64 written in 1989.

	</list>

	Here are some screenshots:
