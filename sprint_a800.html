<h2>Sprint 1 for the Atari 800XL</h2>


In 1978 Atari's wholly-owned subsidiary Kee Games released the arcade game "Sprint 1". It was a one-player sequel
of the earlier two-player car-racing game "Sprint 2" from 1976. The machine was based on a 6502 microcprocessor.
<p>

I now ported that nice game to the Atari 800XL computer by just running the orignal arcade game program
on the Atari. The arcade machine's video and sound hardware are emulated by specific Atari 800 XL routines.
In the homecomputer version the game has to be played with the joystick instead of the original's steering, gearshift,
and accelerator pedal.

<p>
The program can be downloaded as an executable file here: <a href="sprint_a800/sprint1.xex">sprint1.xex</a>

<p>
It is also available as an atr file here: <a href="sprint_a800/sprint1.atr">sprint1.atr</a>


<p>

Below you see some screenshots of the running game:

Have fun!
