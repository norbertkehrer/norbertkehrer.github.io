        <h2>A Behavioral Theory of the Firm in JavaScript</h2>

        Some years ago, I bought a cool book from 1963 at the fleamarket for just 2 Euros. It was written
        by Richard M. Cyert and James G. March from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, and it describes their
        seminal behavioral theory of the firm (see
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Behavioral_Theory_of_the_Firm" target="_blank">[ABTOF]</a>).
        The theory is a model of the decision processes and the formation of goals within companies.
        <p>
            The great thing is, that the book not only contains the verbal description of the
            theory, but also a real quantitative implementation in the form of a computer simulation program of a
            duopoly (two-firm) market. Even more great is, that the authors also included the complete source code
            listing of the program and a full sample printout of a program run in the book (which was actually the
            reason I bought it in the first place ;-).
        </p>
        <p>
            The code is written in the ancient programming language 20-GATE (Generalized Algebraic Translator,
            Extended) for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendix_G-20" target="_blank">Bendix G-20</a>
            mainframe. In an attempt to have a "perfect" translation of the original 20-GATE program to a modern
            platform, I hand-translated the 20-GATE code, statement by statement, to a semantically equivalent
            JavaScript program. Special care was taken to have as much as possible a 1:1 relationship between the
            original and the translated code and to exactly reproduce the original control flow (with quite some
            GOTO statements :-).
        </p>
        <p>
            To make the translation process a little bit clearer, you see in the following a code segment in
            20-GATE and its representation in JavaScript:

        </p>
        <p>
            The original program took a set of punched cards as its input data and produced a long printout of
            data for 50 time periods. The JavaScript version also generates this printout, but I added also a simple
            line graph feature to view the development of a selected variable and the possibility to generate and
            download a "csv" file of all the output data, so that you can analyze it in a spreadsheet, statistics
            package, or in your own self-written programs.
        </p>

            You can try out the simulation directly in your browser here:

            I also published the complete source code of my JavaScript program on
            <a href="https://github.com/norbertkehrer/abtof" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
