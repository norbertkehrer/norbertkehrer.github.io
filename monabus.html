        <h2>MONABUS, A Business Simulation Exercise, in JavaScript</h2>

        <p>
            In 1966, Walter Lewis Brown wrote his master's thesis at the University of Montana, in which he describes
            his management game MONABUS. The exact citation is:
            <blockquote>
                Brown, Walter L., <em>MONABUS - A Business Simulation Exercise</em>, Master's thesis,
                University of Montana, USA, 1966.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The thesis describes a very nice and simple round-based management game, where three teams of students
            can make key decisions, like production volume, selling price etc., for the next time period for their
            respective firms. The game administrator then feeds punch cards with these decision parameters into the
            computer (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620" target="_blank">IBM 1620</a> back in 1966),
            which then simulates their consequences on the market and for the three companies. The outcome is a printout
            with financial statements and market data for the firms. The paper is handed over to the student teams as
            the basis to prepare their decisions for the next period.
        </p>

            The thesis is nicely built-up. It contains an introduction, a manual for the participants, a manual for the
            game administrator, decision forms, and instructions for the operating staff of the computer center.
            Of course, the students were usually not allowed to directly operate the computer by themselves back then
            :-/

            I can tell you, that it is quite fun to play this kind of games. I had the pleasure to participate in such
            a game at my university back in the 1980s. It was called MARKSTRAT (which still exists
            <a href="https://web.stratxsimulations.com" target="_blank">today</a>), also ran on an IBM machine
            (a 4331 mainframe), and, even if it was twenty years later, we as students still had no access
            to the machine itself, but just received paper printouts. I bet, the administrator even fed our decisions
            into the machine via punch cards (the virtual ones, though, which VM/SP, our IBM's operating system,
            emulated as part of its virtual machine engine).
        </p>

            Walter's MONABUS thesis luckily also contains the complete listing of his computer program written in the
            programming language FORTRAN. This is my translation of the original program to JavaScript.
            I made two versions. One, in which I tried to keep the code and the input and output as similar as possible
            to the original, and a second one, where I tried to keep the program semantically equal to the original
            code, but "modernized" it a little bit in the code, by having long variable names, and in the output for the
            browser. It is quite hard to beat the standard parameter setup, actually.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make the translation process a little bit clearer, you see in the following a code segment in
            FORTRAN and its representation in JavaScript:

            You can try out the game directly in your browser here:

                <li>
                    <a href="monabus/monabus_modern.html" target="_blank">MONABUS - modernized</a>.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            I also published the complete source code of my JavaScript program on
