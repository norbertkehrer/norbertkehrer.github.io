	<h2>Background</h2>

	<p>
		In 1966, Walter Lewis Brown wrote his master's thesis at the University of Montana, in which he describes
		his management game MONABUS. The exact citation is:
		<blockquote>
			Brown, Walter L., <em>MONABUS - A Business Simulation Exercise</em>, Master's thesis,
			University of Montana, USA, 1966.
		</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		The thesis describes a very nice and simple round-based management game, where three teams of students
		can make key decisions, like production volume, selling price etc., for the next time period for their
		respective firms. The game administrator then feeds punch cards with these decision parameters into the
		computer (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620" target="_blank">IBM 1620</a> back in 1966),
		which then simulates their consequences on the market and for the three companies. The outcome is a printout
		with financial statements and market data for the firms. The paper is handed over to the student teams as
		the basis to prepare their decisions for the next period.
	</p>
	<p>
		The thesis is nicely built-up. It contains an introduction, a manual for the participants, a manual for the
		game administrator, decision forms, and instructions for the operating staff of the computer center.
		Of course, the students were usually not allowed to directly operate the computer by themselves back then
		:-/
	</p>
	<p>
		I can tell you, that it is quite fun to play these kind of games. I had the pleasure to participate in such
		a game at my university back in the 1980s. It was called MARKSTRAT (which still exists
		<a href="https://web.stratxsimulations.com" target="_blank">today</a>), also ran on an IBM machine
		(a 4331 mainframe), and, even if it was twenty years later, we as students still had no access
		to the machine itself, but just received paper printouts. I bet, the administrator even fed our decisions
		into the machine via punch cards (the virtual ones, though, which VM/SP, our IBM's operating system,
		emulated as part of its virtual machine engine).
	</p>
	<p>
		Walter's MONABUS thesis luckily also contains the complete listing of his computer program written in the
		programming language FORTRAN. This is my translation of the original program to JavaScript.
		I tried to keep the program semantically equal to the original code, but "modernized" it a little bit
		in the code, by	having long variable names, and in the output for the browser.
		It is quite hard to beat the standard parameter setup, actually.
