<h2>The 'LineTo' Bug. A little Game Jam Entry</h2>


	For the first time, I attended a Game Jam. It was held on February 5-6, 2016
	at the at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg, and you
	had 36 hours to write a game on the topic "It's a feature, not a bug".
	This was really great fun and perfectly organized by Florian Jindra and team. Thank you!
	<p>

	I wrote a little (boring) browser game based on a programmer's bug in drawing a square, where the postioning of the
	square was done using a 'LineTo' command instead of a 'MoveTo'. This results in a constantly drawn
	line from the coordinate system's origin to the square you control with the cursor keys.
	The target is to collect all the green squares while avoiding red bullets flying around.
	<p>

	You can try the game directly in your browser clicking here:

	Below you see a screenshot of the running game:
