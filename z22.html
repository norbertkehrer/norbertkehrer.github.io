<h2>Zuse Z22 Emulator</h2>

<h4>The Z22 Machine</h4>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z22_(computer)">Z22</a> was a very early
German computer based on vacuum tube technology. It was built by the
company Zuse KG in 1958, which sold in total 55 machines to customers mainly in
Germany. The machine was used for many applications in science, technology,
and business.

<h4>The Emulator</h4>
I wrote a Z22 emulator in Javascript, so you can try this historical computer
directly in your web browser here:
<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="z22/z22.html" target="_blank">Start the Zuse Z22 Emulator</a>
</ul>
<h4>
	Quick start to running a program
</h4>

To run programs do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Go to the "punched tape reader" tab.</li>
	<li>Load one of the example programs by selecting it in the program drop down menu and press "Load". Or, type in your own program in the editor area.</li>
	<li>Press "Insert Tape".</li>
	<li>Go to the "control panel" tab.</li>
	<li>Press "Befehls&uuml;bernahme".</li>
	<li>Press "Start" to read the program from the paper tape into the computer.</li>
	<li>Press "Start" again to execute the program.</li>
	<li>Go to the "teleprinter" tab to view the output of the program.</li>
</ol>

<h4>
	Learn how to program the machine
</h4>

Very cool sites to learn about the Z22 computer and how to program it are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://museum.informatik.uni-kl.de/Rechner/Zuse/Z22/" target="_blank">R. Kirchner's great
	Z22 documents collection</a> at the computer museum of the Department of Computer Science of the
	Technical University Kaiserslautern.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.wpavel.de/zuse/doku/doku_simu.php" target="_blank">Wolfgang Pavel's great Z22 pages</a>
	with his cool simulator written in PHP.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
	Have fun!<p>Norbert
