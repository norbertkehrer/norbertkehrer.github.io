<h2>Vantris, a Tetris Game For Vanguard Machines</h2>



	Vantris is a homebrew game ROM for the "Vanguard" arcade machine (SNK 1981), which I
	programmed in 1998 in 6502 assembler. It is a new implementation of a classic game
	for an old machine.
	<p>
	Download <a href="vantris/vantris.zip">vantris.zip</a> and play it with the MAME
	emulator. The distribution contains the ROM binaries (MAME naming conventions),
	installation instructions, and the source code.

	<p>
	Here is a screenshot of the running game:

	It is great fun to program these old arcade machines - well at least their
	emulators ;-) Try it, too.
	<p>
	My next project is a Bust-a-move/Puzzle Bobble clone for the Gravitar arcade machine (Atari
	1982) - a vector machine. This is a nice programming challenge, but hard work.
	I have a version with the balls flying around now, but there is still much to do. It will take some time,
	but one day I will finish it ("...because this is better than writing emulators" I say in January 2001).
