    `Astro Fighter in Java by Static Binary Translation`,
    `
            	The arcade game Astro Fighter was originally written by Data East Corporation (DECO) in 1980.
            	Twenty five years later, I made an internet browser version of it by translating the Astro Fighter
            	program code, originally written for the 6502 CPU of the Astro Fighter machine, to Java.
            	The translation was made by a program, which generates	corresponding Java program code for
            	each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques to the generated program
            	(e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations).
            	This project is open source and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your
            	PC or website and with the complete source code in Java.
            	Click <a href="sbt/AstroFighter.html" target="_blank">here</a> to play Astro Fighter now.
            	Download the game from <a href="sbt/AstroFighter.zip" target="_blank">here</a>, but please do not
            	forget to credit DECO for the original game and me for translating it to Java :-)
