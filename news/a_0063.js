    `Mailuefterl Emulator with More Exact Control Desk`,
    `
            	Dr. Moritsch from the Technical Museum in Vienna - now the home of the Mailuefterl computer - sent
            	me some excellent pictures of the control desk of the Mailuefterl. With these photos I could make
            	the layout of my control desk simulation much more like the original. In the next version, I plan
            	to graphically visualize the switches and blinkenlights of the machine, to give a more authentic
            	experience. Many thanks	go to Dr. Moritsch for his precious help.
            	<p>
            	I also continued the work on my Forth compiler for the Mailuefterl and added further kernel primitives.
            	But all is still very much "work-in-progress".
            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to get an impression of the new features.
