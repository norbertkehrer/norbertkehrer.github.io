    `Super Tank on MAME WIP`,
    `
            	Today there was an update to the official <a href="http://www.mame.net/status.html"
            	target="_blank">MAME WIP</a> site announcing my <a href="supertnk.html" target="_blank">Super Tank</a> driver.
            	It reads: "Norbert Kehrer submitted a fully working driver for Super Tank".
            	There are also 4 screenshots added. Nice to be on the official MAME WIP page :-) Thanks!
