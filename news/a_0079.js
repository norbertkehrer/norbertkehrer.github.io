    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - C128 Bug Fix`,
    `
            	There was a bug in the Asteroids Emulator, which made it slower when run on the C128. This was fixed and
            	hopefully it is fine now. Thanks to tokra, WTE, and Alan Reed for bug reporting and testing on the real machine.
            	<p>
