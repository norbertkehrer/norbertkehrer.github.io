            	The genre of wall and brick games was newly defined with Arkanoid. Cool features, attractive graphics,
            	and brilliant gameplay made up the great success of this game.
            	The emulator supports sound by real emulation of the AY8910 sound chip, which was used in the Arkanoid machines.
            	You can control the bat with the cursor keys or the mouse.
