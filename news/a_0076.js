    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Fast Mode on the C128`,
    `
            	Here is another update of the Asteroids Emulator for the C64. The program now checks, if it is running on a C128
            	in C64 mode, and in that case it switches to the 2 MHz clock frequency, when the raster beam is in the border.
            	This method allows a speedup of approximately 30% compared to the genuine C64 and results in smoother movements
            	in the game.
