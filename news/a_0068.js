    `My C64 Programs from the Eighties`,
    `
            	My first own computer was a Commodore 64. I bought it in June 1984 together with a Datasette
            	and a joystick and did quite a lot of programming on it from the beginning. Now I managed
            	to transfer two of my old C64 programs to the PC with a self-built XE1541 cable. They are
            	from 1988 and 1989 and are called "Snake" (a Nibbler clone) and "Tetris" (nomen est omen).
            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="c64.html">my C64 page</a> to download them and try them on the emulator or
            	on the real hardware.
