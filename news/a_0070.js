            	For the <a href="http://www.abbuc.de/index.php/de/atari/software-ressort/101-software-contest-2011" target="_blank">
            	ABBUC Software Contest 2011</a> I wrote an emulator of DEC's PDP-8 minicomputer from 1965 which
            	runs on the Atari 800XL. The program surprisingly was placed fifth in the contest, which I am very
            	happy about. Many thanks to Bunsen, Carsten, and the rest of the ABBUC team for their support and
            	for organizing this unique contest. Thanks also to all the ABBUC members for testing and voting for
            	my program.
            	<p>
            	The Atari PDP-8 emulator can run PDP-8 binary programs on an Atari 800XL. It simulates the machine
            	instructions and the teletype of an original machine with 16k words of main memory. The emulator
            	has been successfully tested with PDP-8 software from the sixties and seventies like CHEKMO-II,
            	the chess program, or the programming languages FOCAL and LISP.
            	<p>
            	You can watch a video of the emulator running the chess programm CHEKMO-II here (thanks to Thorsten for recording it):
