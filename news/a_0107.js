    `Teletext Reader for the Commodore 64 - now with Mass Downloader for All ORF Channels`,
    `
            	Thanks to the great feedback and testing of the colleagues at <a href="https://www.forum64.de" target="_blank">Forum 64</a>
            	I could fix some bugs and make my teletext reader usable for SD2IEC and also for 1541 Ultimate. The version for
            	SD2IEC is called "0teletext.prg" now, and the one working with a 1541 Ultimate is called "0teletextu.prg".
            	<p>
            	I also extended my teletext mass download program to be able to download also the teletext pages of the ORF channels
            	ORF 2, ORF iii, and ORF Sport +. You have to start the page download now with "teletext_orf orf1", "teletext_orf orf2",
            	"teletext_orf orfiii", or "teletext_orf orfsportplus", respectively.  
            	<p>
            	The updated program can be downloaded as a zip file here: <a href="teletext_c64/teletext.zip">teletext.zip</a>.
            	<p>
            
            	Below you see some screenshots from the newly added channels:
