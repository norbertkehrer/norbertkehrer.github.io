    `Flashx20, the Epson HX-20 Floppy and Screen Emulator, now has Graphics Support`,
    `
            	I now also added graphics support to flashx20, my little program to simulate external floppy disk drives
            	and an external	display controller for the Epson HX-20 handheld computer.
            	<p>
            	The commands to draw dots and lines available in Epson BASIC can be used to create high-resolution
            	pictures in up to 8 colors on the screen of a Windows PC connected to the HX-20. The graphics screen is
            	shown in a separate window, so that the text display is still visible in the console.
            	<p>
            	The new version can be downloaded as a zip file containing the "flashx20" program for Windows computers,
            	some BASIC examples and graphics demos to try, and the user manual as a pdf file. You can download the
            	zip archive here:

            	I am still working on a Raspberry Pi version.
            	<p>
            	Here are two example screenshots showing the graphics capabilities (I did not wait for the Mandelbrot set
            	calculation to finish, but took the screenshot after 3 hours of runtime ;-):
