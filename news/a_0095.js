    `Static Binary Translation Talks at the "vienna.js" Meetup in Vienna`,
    `
            	It was a lot of fun for me to present some backgrounds of my static binary translations of old 6502-based arcade games
            	in the really cool monthly meetup of the Vienna JavaScript User Group
            	called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/de/viennajs/" target="_blank">vienna.js</a>. Thanks a lot to all the visitors
            	and to Roland Sch&uuml;tz for organizing it so perfectly and for inviting me.
            
            	<p>
            	You can download my slides here:

            	<p>
            	You can try the translated games here:
            	<ul>
            	<li><a href="ast_js/AsteroidsJS.html" target="_blank">Asteroids (Atari, 1979)</a>
            	<li><a href="centipede_js/CentipedeJS.html" target="_blank">Centipede (Atari, 1981)</a>
            	<li><a href="astrof_js/AstrofJS.html" target="_blank">Astro Fighter (Data East, 1980)</a>
            	</ul>		
            
            	<p>
            	I hope, at least some of you got interested in trying such a translation also. I found it very exciting
            	and surprisingly challenging. You can practice and learn something about code generation and optimization,
            	and at the same time you get a video game.
