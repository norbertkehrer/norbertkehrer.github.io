    `Star Trek and Tac/Scan`,
    `
            	Now almost a year has passed since the last news on this page. As tomorrow is my birthday,
            	I wrote two new game drivers for the Java Arcade Emulator, to celebrate it and to show that
            	emu programming is still big fun for me. Here are:
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="JStarTrek.html" target="_blank">Star Trek</a> and
            		<li>
            		<a href="JTacScan.html" target="_blank">Tac/Scan</a>
            	</ul>
            	These are two great vector games made by Sega in 1982. They are part of a series of vector
            	games based on Sega's G80 hardware platform. More emulators of this series will follow soon.
            	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about these games and to play them online.
