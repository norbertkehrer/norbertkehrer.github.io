    `Youtube Video from Old Mailuefterl Talk (in German)`,
    `
            	There is an old audio recording of a talk about the Austrian "Mailuefterl" computer I gave ten years ago in German language on the
            	<a href="http://www.vcfe.org/D/" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe</a> in Munich (May 1, 2009).
            	I created a video out of that audio file by adding the slides I showed on the talk, and by replacing the live demo
            	with my old Java-based emulator by a demo on my new JavaScript-based Mailuefterl emulator.
            	<p>
            	Here is the video:
