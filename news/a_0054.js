    `New Site Layout`,
    `
            	I made a new layout of my site. It uses frames now for the menu bar on the left-hand side, which
            	makes navigation and maintainance easier.<br>
            	In the last months I have been working on a static binary translator from 6502 machine language
            	to Java and will present my first results soon. Stay tuned.
