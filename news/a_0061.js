    `Mailuefterl Emulator`,
    `
            	The Mailuefterl was the first fully transistorized computer in Europe. It was built at the 
            	Technical University of Vienna (Austria) from 1955 to 1958 by Dr. Heinz Zemanek and his team.
            	I wrote an emulator for this pioneering machine as a Java applet.
            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out software which was
            	written in the 1950ies and probably has not been run for almost 50 years now!
