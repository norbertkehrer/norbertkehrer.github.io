    `Talks at the VCFE about Translation of 6502 Arcade Games to JavaScript and HP Caluclator Emulation`,
    `
            	It was a lot of fun for me to present some backgrounds of my static binary translations of old 6502-based arcade games
            	and of my little emulators of old Hewlett-Packard pocket calculators in the really cool
            	<a href="http://www.vcfe.org" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe</a> in Munich. Thanks a lot to all the visitors
            	and to Hans Franke for organizing it so perfectly every year.
