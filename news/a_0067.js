    `Mailuefterl talk at the VCFE`,
    `
            	I gave a talk about the history and technical aspects of the Mailuefterl computer
            	at the <a href="http://www.vcfe.org" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe
            	(VCFE)</a> in Munich and also showed my emulator there.
            	<p>
            	This was really great fun. Many thanks to all the participants in my presentation
            	and above all to Hans Franke for inviting me and for organizing this great
            	Retro Computing festival every year!
