  "Infernal Runner Compiled to JavaScript",
  `
  <p>
  This is a JavaScript port of the Amstrad CPC game "Infernal Runner" made by Eric Chahi in 1985.
  It is built from the virtual machine interpreter code of Gregory Montoir.
  I compiled the bytecode to native JavaScript in order to eliminate the interpretive layer and
  having the whole game as a pure JavaScript program.
</p>
<p>
  You can try out the game directly in your browser here:
  <ul>
      <li>
          <a href="infernal_runner_compiled/infernal_compiled.html" target="_blank">Infernal Runner Compiled</a>.
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I also published the complete source code of my JavaScript program on
  <a href="https://github.com/norbertkehrer/infernal_runner_compiled" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
