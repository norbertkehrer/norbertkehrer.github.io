    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Another Little Speed Increase`,
    `
            	I made one more little speed optimization of the Asteroids emulator for the Commodore 64. It is noticeable especially
            	when many objects are on the screen. This, I think, is now the last update of the C64 version for the moment.
            	<p>
            
            	Go to my <a href="astc64.html">Commodore 64 Asteroids Emulator page</a> to download the new version, or just
            	grab the new program file here: <a href="astc64/asteroid.prg">asteroid.prg</a>
