    `Galaga for the Atari 800`,
    `
            	In 1982 the German programmer Henrik Wening made a great version of the arcade game Galaga for
            	the Commodore PET computer. The PET, being more a business-oriented computer, had only 
            	very limited graphics and sound capabilities. So the game is graphically very simple but the
            	gameplay is great. There was also a version of it for the Commodore 64, which I
            	loved to play back in the eighties. You can read more on the original PET Galaga
            	version on <a href="http://www.wening.de/" target="_blank">Henrik's homepage</a>
             	(in German).

            	I now ported Henrik's great game to the Atari 800XL computer.
