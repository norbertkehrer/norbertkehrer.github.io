            	the Online NES Emulator is out
            	<p> 
            	The Online NES Emulator (ONE) has been released today. It is a new NES emu written in
            	Java (on the basis of JAE). ONE lets you play NES games online in your browser window. 
            	At the moment there is support for the memory mappers 0, 1, 2, and 3. The number of mappers
            	and supported games will increase soon. 
            	ONE also has sound support. The sound is produced by real-time emulation of the NES Audio Processing
            	Unit. As this had to be done in Java, the sound quality unfortunately is rather bad.<p>
            
            	I made a little selection of games, which already are playable with ONE. You can try them at the
            	<a href="one.html">ONE</a> page.
