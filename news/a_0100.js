    `"Sprint" Talks at the Meetings Technologieplauscherl, vienna.js, Retropulsiv, and VCFE`,
    `
            	It was a lot of fun for me to present the exciting insights into compiler construction and robotics
            	I gained from Atari's classic 1976 arcade game "Sprint"
            	in the really cool monthly meetups "Technologieplauscherl" in Linz and "vienna.js" in Vienna, as well as at the
            	great RETROpulsiv in Augsburg.
