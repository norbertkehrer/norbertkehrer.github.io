                    Ast3DX has been released - a completely redesigned AstDX. Ast3DX is an Asteroids emulator,
            	which emulates Atari's Asteroids arcade machine, only that you play the game from the perspective
            	of the cockpit of your space ship. So Ast3DX is a first person 3D shooter with texture-mapped polygon objects
            	using the absolutely original Atari game play from 1979.
