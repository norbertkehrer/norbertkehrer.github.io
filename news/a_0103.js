    `Phoenix Emulator for the Amstrad CPC`,
    `
            	I recently bought an Amstrad CPC on the flea market. The machine was called Schneider CPC
            	in Austria and Germany, and it is a nice Z80-based home computer from the early eighties.
            	So, I really had to try to program it in its machine language and wrote an emulator
            	of the classic arcade game Phoenix from 1980. The original arcade machine was made by the
            	American company Amstar (sounds a little bit like Amstrad, doesn't it) and had a 8085 CPU.
            	So, the Amstrad CPC can directly run the original game program on its 8085-compatible Z80 CPU. 
            	To emulate the arcade machine's video and sound hardware on the Amstrad home computer
            	I wrote specific Z80 routines. These are still a little bit buggy now.
            	I made two versions. One with sixteen colors but lower resolution, and a second one with the original
            	resolution but with only four colors.
            	<p>
            	Here are two videos of the emulator in action:

            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="phoenix_cpc.html">my CPC Phoenix Emulator page</a> to read more about the emulator
            	and to download it.
            
            	<p>
            	Or download the Amstrad CPC disk file right from here: <a href="phoenix_cpc/phoenix.dsk">phoenix.dsk</a>
            
            	<p>
            
            	You can use this file with a CPC emulator or put it on a floppy disk or on tape and play it on the real machine.
            	The disk image contains two files. Run the file "phoenix" for the 16-color version with lower resolution, or
            	alternatively run the file "phoenixh" for the 4-color version with high resolution.
