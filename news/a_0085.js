    `Asteroids 8-bit Emulation Paper in "Shift - Restore - Escape" Conference Proceedings`,
    `
            	I had the honor to give a talk at Stefan H&ouml;ltgen's great series of retrocomputing lectures "Shift - Restore - Escape",
            	which he organized at the renowned Humboldt University in Berlin in 2013. I spoke about my emulators
            	of the "Asteroids" arcade game on the vintage home computers Commodore 64, Atari 800XL, Commodore 128,
            	and Commodore Plus/4, and it was really great, great fun. Stefan asked the speakers to write papers about
            	their talks, and he compiled a superb book in German language called
            	"Shift - Restore - Escape, Retrocomputing und Computerarch&auml;ologie" out of that.
            	<p>
            	Today, this book, which is in a way the "Conference Proceedings" of Stefan H&ouml;ltgen's lecture series, was published by
            	the "CSW | Verlag", which is very well known for its numerous retrocomputing and retrogaming titles.
            	<p>
            	The book contains a fantastic selection of contributions to the modern retrocomputing scene and community, and also my
            	paper titled "Asteroids auf 8-Bit-Heimcomputern, Portierung des Spielautomatenklassikers". I think the book is a must-have
            	for every German-speaking retrocomputing fan.
