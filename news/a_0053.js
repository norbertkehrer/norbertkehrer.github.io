    `Tailgunner in Java by Static Binary Recompilation`,
    `
            	Today is my birthday and I can present a new program here :-). It is an exact port of the 25 year old
            	classic arcade game "Tailgunner". I did this little project together with Graham Toal.<br>
            	Tailgunner is a nice vector game made by Dan Sunday of the company Vectorbeam in 1979. Vectorbeam and
            	the game were sold to Cinematronics later. Tailgunner was very advanced for its time. It is probably
            	the first 3D vector game (older than Battlezone). This time the exact reproduction of the game is not
            	achieved by a conventional CPU emulator, but by so-called static binary recompilation.
            	<a href="http://www.gtoal.com" target="_blank">Graham Toal</a> wrote a really cool program, which can
            	translate the original game code from C-CPU machine language to C. With Graham's help I ported his generated
            	code to Java and added the graphical Java environment to play the game in an applet.
            	Thank you Graham, it was a cool project :-)
            	The program is open source, and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your
            	PC or website and with the complete Java source code.
