    `Atari Calculator for the Commodore 64`,
    `
            	In 1979 Atari shipped a program called "Atari Calculator" for the Atari 800 computers.
            	It provides the functionality of powerful, programmable scientific and financial calculators
            	on the Atari home computer. I heard an interesting talk on it given by Roland B. Wassenberg on
            	the Vintage Computer Festival 2013 in Munich, got interested, and now ported this program
            	to the Commodore 64.

            	Here is a screenshot of the result (note the Atari font ;-):
