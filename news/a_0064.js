    `Improvements in the Mailuefterl Emulator`,
    `
            	Last week, I had a really interesting discussion with leading members of the
            	Austrian Computer Society and got some very good feedback on possible improvements in the
            	user interface of my Mailuefterl Emulator. Based on that, I changed the multi-window oriented
            	structure of the user interface to a single-window view, to make the use of the program
            	less confusing. The different I/O devices of the Mailuefterl will now be shown alternatingly
            	in one window. I also removed the flickering of the blinkenlights display and added another
            	little Mailuefterl program, which prints out the squares of integers.
            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out the improved version.
