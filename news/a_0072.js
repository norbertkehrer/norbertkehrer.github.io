    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64`,
    `
            	I did now the same exercise on the Commodore 64 as on the Atari 800XL a few months ago and
            	wrote an emulator of Atari's classic 1979 arcade game "Asteroids" running on the C64.
            	In the Asteroids emulator the "emulation" of the arcade machine's CPU is performed by the 6510 processor of
            	the C64 itself, i.e. the original arcade program is directly executed on the home computer.
            	The sophisticated video and sound hardware of the arcade machine is simulated by my Asteroids
            	emulator program. The C64&#8212;due to its lower clock frequency&#8212;is slower than the Atari 800XL
            	and has a more complex graphics representation. So, the challenge to make the emulator more or less
            	fast enough on this small 8-bit home computer was really a big one for me.

            	Here is now a video of the emulator in action:
