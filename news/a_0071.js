    `Asteroids Emulator for the Atari 800XL`,
    `
            	For the <a href="http://www.abbuc.de" target="_blank">
            	ABBUC Software Contest 2012</a> I wrote an emulator of Atari's classic arcade game "Asteroids" from
            	1979 which runs on the Atari 800XL. My program was placed third in the contest with very strong
            	competitors, who all submitted really great new software for the old Atari 8-bit home computers.
            	So I am very happy to be among the three best and would like to thank Sascha and the rest of the
            	ABBUC team for organizing this great contest. Thanks also to Peter Dell for the discussions and for the
            	cool WUDSN IDE, to Carsten Strotmann for his support and the discussions, and to all the ABBUC members
            	for testing and voting for my program.
            	<p>
            	In the Asteroids emulator the "emulation" of the arcade machine's CPU is done by the 6502 processor of
            	the 8-bit Atari itself, i.e. the original arcade program is directly executed on the home computer.
            	The sophisticated video and sound hardware of the arcade machine is simulated by my Asteroids
            	emulator program. The biggest challenge in this project was to make the emulator fast enough on the
            	small Atari computer, which is probably less (!) powerful than the emulated arcade machine.
            	<p>
            	Here is a video of the emulator:
