    `Tailgunner in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation`,
    `
            	Fifteen years after a very nice little Java project, I now repeated the same exercise in JavaScript.
            	It is an exact port of the 40 year old classic arcade game "Tailgunner", which I did together with Graham Toal.
            	<p>
            	Tailgunner is a vector game programmed by Dan Sunday of the company Vectorbeam in 1979. Vectorbeam and
            	the game were sold to Cinematronics later. Tailgunner was very advanced for its time and is probably
            	the first 3D vector game (older than Atari's Battlezone). This exact reproduction of the game was not
            	achieved by a conventional CPU emulator, but by so-called static binary translation. Back in 2004,
            	Graham Toal wrote a really cool program, with which he automatically
            	translated the original game code from its specific CPU's machine language to C. With Graham's help I ported his generated
            	C code first to Java, and now to JavaScript, and added a graphical HTML5/JavaScript environment in order to make
            	the game playable in web browsers.
