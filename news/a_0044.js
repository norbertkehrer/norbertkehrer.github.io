    `Battlezone`,

            	After a long time, I am back with a new game for the Java Arcade Emulator (the 40th game).
            	Is is Atari's cool vector game
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="JBattleZone.html" target="_blank">Battlezone</a>
            	</ul>
            	In 1980 Atari's programmer Ed Rotberg created this excellent piece of software,
            	which I think was the first realistic 3D simulation game.
            	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about the game and to play it online.
