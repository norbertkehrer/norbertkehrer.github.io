                    <li>
            	JAE supports 22 games now. I added the cool <a href="JBagman.html" target = "_blank">
            	  Bagman</a> (Valadon Automation 1982) 
                      and Midway's famous vector game <a href="JOmegaRace.html" target = "_blank">
            	  Omega Race</a>.
                    Go to the
            	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a>
                     section to read more about the games and to play them online.</li>

                    <li>
            	I also made some small graphics improvements in 
            	<a href="JAsteroids.html">Asteroids</a>
            	and
            	<a href="JAsteroidsDeluxe.html">Asteroids Deluxe</a>.
            	Unfortunately, Asteroids Deluxe still resets after some time of playing. I don't know why, yet.
            	</li>
            
                </ul>
