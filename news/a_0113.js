    `Zuse Z22 Emulator in JavaScript`,
    `
            	The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z22_(computer)">Z22</a> was a very early
            	German computer based on vacuum tube technology. It was built by the
            	company Zuse KG in 1958, which sold in total 55 machines to customers mainly in
            	Germany. The machine was used for many applications in science, technology,
            	and business. I wrote a Z22 emulator in Javascript, so you can try this historical computer
            	directly in your web browser here:
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="z22/z22.html" target="_blank">Start the Zuse Z22 Emulator</a>
            	</ul>
            	I wrote (very short) instructions on how to use the emulator. You find them in the "About"
            	tab in the emulator or on
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="z22.html">my Zuse Z22 page</a>.
            	</ul>
            	Now try out software which was written 60 years ago and make new one!
            	<p>
            	Here are some screenshots of the emulator in action:
