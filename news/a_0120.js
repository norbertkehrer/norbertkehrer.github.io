    `Plasma Demo in Raw Webassembly`,
    `
            	Yesterday I attended the fantastic unconference "SoCraTes Days" and hosted a little session on programming
            	directly in raw Webassembly (without compiling from C, Rust, Go, or something like that). It was really a lot of
            	fun. Thanks to all who joined me in the session and to the organizers of this great event. If you ever have the chance
            	to go to a SoCraTes conference, do it (<a href="https://socrates-conference.at" target="_blank">socrates-conference.at</a>).
            	<p>
            	I wrote a little Plasma demo in WA for my session. You can watch it here: <a href="wasm_demo/demo.html" target="_blank">Norbert's WASM Plasma</a>
            	<p>
            	This is a screenshot to give you an impression of the game:
