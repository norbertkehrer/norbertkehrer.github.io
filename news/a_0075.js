    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Speed Increase`,
    `
            	I received more positive feedback in the last days. Many thanks again to all of you.
            	I made a further little speed optimization of the Asteroids emulator, and it should be faster now especially when more
            	objects are on the screen.
            	<p>
            
            	Go to my <a href="astc64.html">Commodore 64 Asteroids Emulator page</a> to download the new version, or just
            	get the new program file here: <a href="astc64/asteroid.prg">asteroid.prg</a>
