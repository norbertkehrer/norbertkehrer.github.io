            	Here is the next vector game for the Java Arcade Emulator:
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="JRedBaron.html" target="_blank">Red Baron</a>
            	</ul>
            	Atari made this 3D flight simulation game in 1980 and used almost the same hardware
            	as for the Battlezone machine.
            	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about Red Baron and to play it online.
