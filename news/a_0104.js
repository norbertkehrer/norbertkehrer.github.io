    `Mailuefterl Emulator in JavaScript`,
    `
            	The Mailuefterl (German for "may breeze", an allusion to much bigger US computers
            	like "Whirlwind" or "Typhoon") was the first fully transistorized computer
            	in Europe. It was built at the 
            	Technical University of Vienna (Austria) from 1955 to 1958 by Dr. Heinz Zemanek and his team.
            	In 2007 I wrote an emulator for this pioneering machine as a Java applet, which does not
            	work any more on modern browsers. So, ten years later, it was really high time for a port to
            	JavaScript. You can now again try this historical computer directly in your internet browser
            	here:
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="mailuefterl/mailuefterl.html" target="_blank">Start the Mailuefterl Emulator</a>
            	</ul>
            	I also wrote short instructions on how to use the emulator, and I summarized the complete
            	instruction set of the machine on
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a>.
            	</ul>
            	Go there to read more and to try out software which was written in the 1950ies and probably has
            	not been run for almost 60 years now!
            	<p>
            	Here are some screenshots of the emulator in action:
