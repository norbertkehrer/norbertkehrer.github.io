    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore Plus/4`,
    `
            	I ported my Asteroids Emulator for the C64 to the Commodore Plus/4. The conversion was quite an interesting
            	task. The Plus/4 is similar but faster than the C64 due to the automatic switch to a higher clock 
            	frequency, whenever the raster beam is in the screen border or in VBLANK. Sound in the emulator is rather
            	poor, though, due to the limited capabilities of the Plus/4's TED chip.

            	Go to my <a href="astplus4.html">Commodore Plus/4 Asteroids Emulator page</a> to download the new version, or just
            	get the new program file here: <a href="astplus4/astplus4.prg">astplus4.prg</a>
