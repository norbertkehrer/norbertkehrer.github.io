    `NOSE, the SMS emulator, is online`,

            	After a lot of arcade game emulators, I had to try something (slightly) different. I wrote an emulator for the
            	Sega Master System (SMS) in Java which lets you play SMS games in your browser. The new emulator is called
            	<a href="nose.html">NOSE</a>, Norbert's Online Sega Master System Emulator :-) It is based on JAE and ONE and
            	offers the following features:
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		emulation of the Z80 CPU of the SMS
            		<li>
            		emulation of the Sega Video Display Processor (similar to Texas Instruments' TMS9918/9928)
            		<li>
            		emulation of the SN76496 sound chip made by Texas Instruments and used in the SMS
            	</ul>
            	NOSE will be improved in later versions and more games will be added. For the moment, I have only uploaded
            	one game, but it is THE game for the Sega Master System: <a href="nose.html">Sonic the Hedgehog</a><p>
            	Go to the
            	<a href="nose.html">NOSE page</a> to read more about it and to play "Sonic" online!
