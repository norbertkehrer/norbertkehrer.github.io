    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Improved Sound`,
    `
            	Thanks to all the people interested in this program for their nice feedback in the last days.
            	I now improved the sound of the Asteroids emulator (especially the saucers) and
            	also could find a possibility for a small speedup (a little bit more to come hopefully).
            	<p>
            
            	Go to <a href="astc64.html">my Commodore 64 Asteroids Emulator page</a> to download the new version, or just
            	get the new program file here: <a href="astc64/asteroid.prg">asteroid.prg</a>
