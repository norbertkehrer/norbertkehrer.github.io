    `MAME Driver for Super Tank`,
    `
            	After so much Java emulation, I had to try something different and decided to make my first contribution to
            	<a href="http://www.mame.net">MAME</a>.
            	I wrote a driver for the still unemulated game
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="supertnk.html" target="_blank">Super Tank</a>
            	</ul>
            	The game was made in 1981 by the German company Video Games GmbH, and AFAIK it was licensed to Computran for
            	the US market.
            	Go to <a href="supertnk.html">my Super Tank page</a> to read more about the game and the story of my driver for it.
