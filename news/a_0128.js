  "Soundtrakker Player now has a piano roll display",
  `
  <p>
  I added a piano roll display to my little Soundtrakker player to choose as an alternative
  to the classic note/instrument/effect display. I also included the possibility to mute each channel individually.

  <p>
  If you want to try the new version just go to
  <a href="st_player/st_player.html" target="_blank">Amstrad CPC Soundtrakker Player</a>.

  <p>
    Here is a screen shot showing the piano roll display:
