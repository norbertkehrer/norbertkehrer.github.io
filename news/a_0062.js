    `Mailuefterl Emulator now with Relay I/O`,
    `
            	I extended my Java Mailuefterl emulator by a simulation of the the relay I/O capabilities of the
            	original machine. I also included an original program from 1960, which uses these features.
            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out this great old software.
