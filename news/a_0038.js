            	At last, I had a little time to work on a game, that I have been trying to emulate in JAE for a long time.
            	Now I succeded to solve most of the problems I had with it. It is the excellent arcade version of 
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		<a href="JATetris.html" target="_blank">Tetris</a>
            	</ul>
            	made by Atari Games in 1988. Some nice additions to the classic game idea and a huge number of different levels
            	make this Tetris version one of the most enjoyables.<br>
            	The emulator does not perfectly emulate all of the graphics, because the Tetris machine used
            	a dynamic color pallette. To compensate for this, a real-time emulation of Atari's famous "Pokey" sound chip
            	was added, so that you can listen to the cool russian-style tunes, that Tetris plays with its two Pokey chips.
            	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about the game and to play Tetris online!
