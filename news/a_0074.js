    `Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Now also for the SuperCPU`,
    `
            	I made now also a version of the Asteroids emulator for a C64 with the SuperCPU (20 MHz 6510-compatible processor) for the
            	lucky ones who own such a device. I do not have one, so I could only test the program in the emulator. With
            	this massive boost in computing power the game runs quite smoothly.
            	<p>
            
            	Go to <a href="astc64.html">my Commodore 64 Asteroids Emulator page</a> to download the SuperCPU version, or just
            	get the program file here: <a href="astc64/astscpu.prg">astscpu.prg</a>
