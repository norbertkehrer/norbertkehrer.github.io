    `YM-64, my YM music player for the Commodore 64`,
    `
            	YM-64 is a program to play so-called ym files on the Commodore 64.
            	Ym files usually contain music written for the Atari ST,
            	the Amstrad/Schneider CPC, or the Sinclair ZX spectrum. YM-64 emulates the YM2149
            	sound chip used in that computers and by that makes it possible to play their
            	music also on Commodore 64 computers.
            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="ym64.html">my YM-64 page</a> to download many YM files converted to C64
            	programs and to try them on an emulator or on the real hardware. Additionally, all the programs
            	are available in the popular sid file format.
