<h2>Old News</h2>

	<h3 id="2016_12_01">December 1, 2016: Phoenix Emulator for the Amstrad CPC</h3>
	I recently bought an Amstrad CPC on the flea market. The machine was called Schneider CPC
	in Austria and Germany, and it is a nice Z80-based home computer from the early eighties.
	So, I really had to try to program it in its machine language and wrote an emulator
	of the classic arcade game Phoenix from 1980. The original arcade machine was made by the
	American company Amstar (sounds a little bit like Amstrad, doesn't it) and had a 8085 CPU.
	So, the Amstrad CPC can directly run the original game program on its 8085-compatible Z80 CPU. 
	To emulate the arcade machine's video and sound hardware on the Amstrad home computer
	I wrote specific Z80 routines. These are still a little bit buggy now.
	I made two versions. One with sixteen colors but lower resolution, and a second one with the original
	resolution but with only four colors.
	<p>
	Here are two videos of the emulator in action:

	<p>
	Go to <a href="phoenix_cpc.html">my CPC Phoenix Emulator page</a> to read more about the emulator
	and to download it.

	<p>
	Or download the Amstrad CPC disk file right from here: <a href="phoenix_cpc/phoenix.dsk">phoenix.dsk</a>

	<p>

	You can use this file with a CPC emulator or put it on a floppy disk or on tape and play it on the real machine.
	The disk image contains two files. Run the file "phoenix" for the 16-color version with lower resolution, or
	alternatively run the file "phoenixh" for the 4-color version with high resolution.

	<h3 id="2016_04_18">April 18, 2016: BTX-Server to connect your old Videotex terminal to the PC</h3>

	In Austria and Germany there was in the 1980s a Videotex system called "BTX" or
	"Bildschirmtext" (German for "screen text").
	I wrote a little server in JavaScript, which lets you connect your old Videotex
	decoders to a PC. With that, you can call up old Videotex pages stored as files on your
	PC and view them on the decoder.

	<p>
	Here is the server in action showing an old German BTX page on my Mupid, a cool
	Austrian Videotex decoder from the eighties:
	<p>
	<img src="media/Mupid_BTX_2016.jpg" alt="Norbert Kehrer's Mupid with a BTX page">

	<p>
	And here is the BTX server software as a zip file for download: <a href="btx_server/btx_server.zip">btx_server.zip</a>

	<p>
	Installation and usage instructions are included in the zip file.
	The software is still at a very early stage and still buggy, but you can call up a BTX
	page via *page# like back the old days. So, there is more to come ...

	<p>
	If you are a lucky Mupid owner, try out my Forth interpreter for that decoder (actually a FIG Forth port). 
	Start the BTX server, change to the forth directory with "cd forth", press the blue "K"
	and then "A" on the Mupid, and then call up the BTX page with "*mupidforth#". After some loading you have the
	old interactive programming language Forth available for your own Mupid experiments.

	<h3 id="2016_02_05">February 5-6, 2016: The 'LineTo' Bug. A little Game Jam Entry</h3>
	For the first time, I attended a Game Jam. It was held at the at the University of
	Applied Sciences in Salzburg, and you
	had 36 hours to write a game on the topic "It's a feature, not a bug".
	This was really great fun and perfectly organized by Florian Jindra and team. Thank you!
	<p>

	I wrote a little (boring) browser game based on a programmer's bug in drawing a square, where the postioning of the
	square was done using a 'LineTo' command instead of a 'MoveTo'. This results in a constantly drawn
	line from the coordinate system's origin to the square you control with the cursor keys.
	The target is to collect all the green squares while avoiding red bullets flying around.
	<p>

	You can try the game directly in your browser clicking here:

	<h3 id="2015_10_03">October 3, 2015: Sprint 1 Ported to the Commodore 64</h3>
	After the conversion for the Atari 800XL, I now made also a port of the old, but very nice car-racing game
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_2" target="_blank">Sprint</a> to the Commodore 64. The
	original game was written by Atari back
	in 1976 (Sprint 2 for two players) and in 1978 (Sprint1 for one player).
	<p>

	I ported the game to the Commodore 64 computer by just running the orignal arcade game program
	on the home computer. The arcade machine's video and sound hardware are emulated by specific C64 routines.
	In the home computer version the game has to be played with the joystick instead of the original's steering, gearshift,
	and accelerator pedal.
	<p>

	The game can be downloaded as an PRG file here: <a href="sprint_c64/sprint1.prg">sprint1.prg</a>

	<h3 id="2015_08_02">August 2, 2015: Sprint in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation (now also in 3D ;-)</h3>
	I made another static binary translation of a 6502 CPU-based arcade game to JavaScript.
	It is the old, but very nice car-racing game
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_2" target="_blank">Sprint</a>, which
	was originally written by Atari back
	in 1976 (Sprint 2 for two players) and in 1978 (Sprint1 for one player), respectively.
	<p>
	The JavaScript code was automatically translated from the original game's program code. A Prolog
	program generates semantically equivalent JavaScript code for each 6502 instruction and applies some
	optimization techniques to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations). The outcome is
	an exact simulation of the original arcade game. The graphics interface and the emulation of the Sprint video hardware
	were directly coded in JavaScript and rely on HTML5 and the Canvas element.
	<p>
	The video hardware of the old arcade machine was only capable of showing very simple 2D character-based
	playfield graphics with four moving objects (sprites). Today's car-driving games normally have 3D graphics, so I
	thought it would be nice to have a 3D interface also for Sprint. I wrote an alternative video hardware
	simulator for Sprint, where the same video RAM and sprite hardware registers, which the original Sprint video circuitry
	shows as simple 2D character graphics, are interpreted as coordinates and objects in
	three-dimensional space. The orignal game, in which you take a bird's eye view
	of the race track, becomes a 3D game seen from the first-person perspective of the driver's seat. But keep in mind, that it is
	still the completely same game logic and the same program from 1976 running, just graphically interpreted differently!
	<p>
	My 3D modelling and programming skills (and also my computer's graphics card speed) are quite limited, so my 3D version is
	very simple and still suffers from - what I think are - bugs in the (apart from that, really great)
	Three.js JavaScript 3D library. So, please consider this just a proof of concept.
	<p>
	<a href="sprint_js/SprintJS.html" target="_blank">Now, click here to try Sprint directly in your browser.</a>.
	It is an arcade game, so don't forget to insert coins first by pressing the "5" key, and then start it with the "1" key.

	<h3 id="2015_06_24">June 24, 2015: Static Binary Translation Talks at the "vienna.js" Meetup in Vienna</h3>
	It was a lot of fun for me to present some backgrounds of my static binary translations of old 6502-based arcade games
	in the really cool monthly meetup of the Vienna JavaScript User Group
	called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/de/viennajs/" target="_blank">vienna.js</a>. Thanks a lot to all the visitors

	<p>
	I hope, at least some of you got interested in trying such a translation also. I found it very exciting
	and surprisingly challenging. You can practice and learn something about code generation and optimization,
	and at the same time you get a video game.

	I added now support for floppy disk drives to the IBM 5110 emulator. Four
	disks are linked: IBM's "Customer Support Functions", "Diagnostic Diskette", and
	"Serial I/O Diskette", and an empty disk. Storing something to disk also works,
	but it is lost, when you leave the browser. I still have to find some good
	persistence model for JavaScript.

	<h3 id="2015_05_25">May 25, 2015: IBM 5110 Emulator in JavaScript</h3>
	The IBM 5100 and 5110 were IBM's first "portable" computers. They had interpreters 
	of the machine languages of IBM's much bigger machines System/3 and System/360 in their ROMs,
	and so this small computer could execute (slightly adapted) BASIC and APL language
	implementations of the large machines. The IBM 5110 was the first "real" computer I worked
	on. We had one in our school, and many thanks go to my physics and to my chemistry teacher
	for letting us work on this (for me) mega-expensive machine in school back in the early eighties.
	There was no dedicated computer science course at our school,
	but the two teachers showed us how the 5110 can be used to solve physics and chemistry problems and 
	introduced us to the fascinating world of computer programming.
	<p>
	I now wrote a JavaScript emulator of the IBM 5110 to be used directly in the web browser.
	It is a port of
	<a href="http://computermuseum.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/dev_en/ibm_5110/ibm_5110.html" target="_blank">Christian Corti</a>'s
	great emulator, which he wrote for Unix systems. There are probably still some bugs and issues with the keyboard mapping,
	and disk and tape support are still missing. I am working on it, though, and I am looking for dumps of 5110 disks or tapes
	to use as test cases. If you happen to have such files, please send me an <a href="email.html">email</a>.

	I made another static binary translation of a 6502-based arcade game to JavaScript.
	It is the great game Centipede, which was originally written by Atari back in 1980.
	<p>
	The translation was automatized by my Prolog program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations). The outcome is
	an exact simulation of the original arcade game.
	The graphics interface and the emulation of the Centipede video hardware

	The arcade game Astro Fighter was originally written by Data East Corporation (DECO) in 1980.
	It was one of the first arcade games I ever played, though the version
	we had in our pub was called Astro Wars (a remake based on a Signetics 2650 CPU by
	the Italian company Zaccaria).
	<p>
	The translation was automatized by a Prolog program, which generates semantically equivalent

	<h3 id="2014_11_06">November 6, 2014: Hewlett-Packard Calculator Emulators for the Atari 800XL now with two "Colors"</h3>
	The Atari 800XL versions of my HP calculator emulators only had a black-and-white screen up to now.
	Thanks to ClausB from the AtariAge board for pointing out the method to use player-missile graphics
	to produce another "color" (dark grey), and very special thanks to Adam Wachowski for explaining me so
	patiently how this really works on the Atari. For a guy like me, who "grew up" with a C64, the way
	the 8-bit Atari's video hardware works still seems a little bit strange.  

	<p>

	And this is how it looks like now:

	<h3 id="2014_10_25">October 25, 2014: Hewlett-Packard Calculator Emulators for the Atari 800XL and for the Commodore 64</h3>
	In 1972 the great American company Hewlett-Packard shipped their first pocket calculator.
	It was called HP-35, and it was the first pocket calculator with transcendental functions
	and the first with the so-called Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
	The HP-35 was a huge success with scientific/engineering users, so HP soon came out with
	a similar model for business users. It was called HP-80, and could solve problems like
	present and future values of payment streams, trend line calculations (least squares
	linear regression), ammortization, date calculation, etc.
	Hewlett-Packard continued with the HP-45, an improved scientific model (which I
	happen to own :-), and (after the models 65 and 70) with the HP-55, which was programmable
	and supported a quartz-controlled stopwatch function.
	These (so-called "classic") calculators of HP were based upon a proprietary 4-bit CPU
	developed just for that purpose.
	<p>
	I now wrote emulators for these four calculators for the Atari 800XL and for the Commodore 64,
	which simulate the HP calculator CPU to interpret the original program ROMs of the four models.
	This enables you to work with your Atari 800 or C64 exactly like with the great classic HP
	calculators with their sophisticated scientific and business functions.

	<h3 id="2014_10_11">October 11, 2014: Hewlett-Packard 45 Calculator in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	The Hewlett-Packard 45 is a great calculator. It was introduced in 1973
	and was HP's second scientific calculator.
	<p>
	This JavaScript version was created more than 40 years later by the method of static binary translation.
	That means, that the calculator's program code originally written in the machine language of HP's special 4-bit CPU
	used in the HP-45 was converted one-to-one to JavaScript.
	The translation was automatized by a JavaScript program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each CPU instruction. The outcome is an exact simulation of the original HP-45 calculator.

	<h3 id="2014_09_15">September 15, 2014: Asteroids 8-bit Emulation Paper in "Shift - Restore - Escape" Conference Proceedings</h3>
	I had the honor to give a talk at Stefan H&ouml;ltgen's great series of retrocomputing lectures "Shift - Restore - Escape",
	which he organized at the renowned Humboldt University in Berlin in 2013. I spoke about my emulators
	of the "Asteroids" arcade game on the vintage home computers Commodore 64, Atari 800XL, Commodore 128,
	and Commodore Plus/4, and it was really great, great fun. Stefan asked the speakers to write papers about
	their talks, and he compiled a superb book in German language called
	"Shift - Restore - Escape, Retrocomputing und Computerarch&auml;ologie" out of that.
	<p>
	Today, this book, which is in a way the "Conference Proceedings" of Stefan H&ouml;ltgen's lecture series, was published by
	the "CSW | Verlag", which is very well known for its numerous retrocomputing and retrogaming titles.
	<p>
	The book contains a fantastic selection of contributions to the modern retrocomputing scene and community, and also my
	paper titled "Asteroids auf 8-Bit-Heimcomputern, Portierung des Spielautomatenklassikers". I think the book is a must-have
	for every German-speaking retrocomputing fan.

	<h3 id="2014_06_06">June 6, 2014: Asteroids in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	I wanted to learn something about making games in JavaScript based on HTML5 and its
	Canvas element and tried to redo a Java project of mine from almost ten years ago in JavaScript now.
	<p>
	I translated Atari's great vector arcade game Asteroids to JavaScript.
	Asteroids was originally written by Ed Logg of Atari Inc. in 1979, and 
	my JavaScript version was created by applying the method of static binary translation to Ed's code.
	That means, that the program code originally written in the machine language of the 6502 CPU
	of the Asteroids machine was converted in a one-to-one manner to JavaScript.
	The translation was automatized by a Java program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations). The outcome is
	an exact simulation of the original, first Asteroids game.
	<p>
	The graphics interface and the emulation of the Asteroids arcade machine's vector generator hardware
	were directly coded in JavaScript and rely on HTML5 and the Canvas element.
	So you should have a quite recent browser version supporting these features to be able to play the game.

	<h3 id="2013_12_29">December 29, 2013: Galaga for the Atari 800</h3>
	In 1982 the German programmer Henrik Wening made a great version of the arcade game Galaga for
	the Commodore PET computer. The PET, being more a business-oriented computer, had only 
	very limited graphics and sound capabilities. So the game is graphically very simple but the
	gameplay is great. There was also a version of it for the Commodore 64, which I
	loved to play back in the eighties. You can read more on the original PET Galaga
	version on <a href="http://www.wening.de/" target="_blank">Henrik's homepage</a>
 	(in German).

	<p>

	I now ported Henrik's great game to the Atari 800XL computer.

	<h3 id="2013_07_12">July 12, 2013: Atari Calculator for the Commodore 64</h3>
	In 1979 Atari shipped a program called "Atari Calculator" for the Atari 800 computers.
	It provides the functionality of powerful, programmable scientific and financial calculators
	on the Atari home computer. I heard an interesting talk on it given by Roland B. Wassenberg on
	the Vintage Computer Festival 2013 in Munich, got interested, and now ported this program
	to the Commodore 64.

	I ported my Asteroids Emulator for the C64 to the Commodore Plus/4. The conversion was quite an interesting
	task. The Plus/4 is similar but faster than the C64 due to the automatic switch to a higher clock 
	frequency, whenever the raster beam is in the screen border or in VBLANK. Sound in the emulator is rather
	poor, though, due to the limited capabilities of the Plus/4's TED chip.

	Here is another update of the Asteroids Emulator for the C64. The program now checks, if it is running on a C128
	in C64 mode, and in that case it switches to the 2 MHz clock frequency, when the raster beam is in the border.
	This method allows a speedup of approximately 30% compared to the genuine C64 and results in smoother movements
	in the game.

	I did now the same exercise on the Commodore 64 as on the Atari 800XL a few months ago and
	wrote an emulator of Atari's classic 1979 arcade game "Asteroids" running on the C64.
	In the Asteroids emulator the "emulation" of the arcade machine's CPU is performed by the 6510 processor of
	the C64 itself, i.e. the original arcade program is directly executed on the home computer.
	The sophisticated video and sound hardware of the arcade machine is simulated by my Asteroids
	emulator program. The C64&#8212;due to its lower clock frequency&#8212;is slower than the Atari 800XL
	and has a more complex graphics representation. So, the challenge to make the emulator more or less
	fast enough on this small 8-bit home computer was really a big one for me.
	<p>
	Here is now a video of the emulator in action:

	I gave a talk about the history and technical aspects of the Mailuefterl computer
	at the <a href="http://www.vcfe.org" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe
	(VCFE)</a> in Munich and also showed my emulator there.
	<p>
	This was really great fun. Many thanks to all the participants in my presentation
	and above all to Hans Franke for inviting me and for organizing this great
	Retro Computing festival every year!
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>



	<h3 id="2008_11_27">November 27, 2008: Debugger for the Mailuefterl Emulator</h3>
	I added a simple debugger (well it's actually just a tracer) to my Mailuefterl emulator.
	It allows to follow the execution of a program step by step. This is nice for Mailuefterl
	programmers of the 21st century, the guys in the 1950ies of course had to make it without
	such a tool.
	<p>
	I also included a little "hello world" program.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try it.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3 id="2008_11_08">November 8, 2008: Prime Number Generator for the Mailuefterl</h3>
	I wrote another little demo program for the Mailuefterl. It is a simple prime number generator.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try it on my emulator.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3 id="2008_11_01">November 1, 2008: Improvements in the Mailuefterl Emulator</h3>
	Last week, I had a really interesting discussion with leading members of the
	Austrian Computer Society and got some very good feedback on possible improvements in the
	user interface of my Mailuefterl Emulator. Based on that, I changed the multi-window oriented
	structure of the user interface to a single-window view, to make the use of the program
	less confusing. The different I/O devices of the Mailuefterl will now be shown alternatingly
	in one window. I also removed the flickering of the blinkenlights display and added another
	little Mailuefterl program, which prints out the squares of integers.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out the improved version.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3 id="2007_02_21">February 21, 2007: Mailuefterl Emulator with More Exact Control Desk</h3>
	Dr. Moritsch from the Technical Museum in Vienna - now the home of the Mailuefterl computer - sent
	me some excellent pictures of the control desk of the Mailuefterl. With these photos I could make
	the layout of my control desk simulation much more like the original. In the next version, I plan
	to graphically visualize the switches and blinkenlights of the machine, to give a more authentic
	experience. Many thanks	go to Dr. Moritsch for his precious help.
	<p>
	I also continued the work on my Forth compiler for the Mailuefterl and added further kernel primitives.
	But all is still very much "work-in-progress".
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to get an impression of the new features.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3 id="2007_02_07">February 7, 2007: Mailuefterl Emulator now with Relay I/O</h3>
	I extended my Java Mailuefterl emulator by a simulation of the the relay I/O capabilities of the
	original machine. I also included an original program from 1960, which uses these features.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out this great old software.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3 id="2007_02_02">February 2, 2007: Mailuefterl Emulator</h3>
	The Mailuefterl was the first fully transistorized computer in Europe. It was built at the 
	Technical University of Vienna (Austria) from 1955 to 1958 by Dr. Heinz Zemanek and his team.
	I wrote an emulator for this pioneering machine as a Java applet.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out software which was
	written in the 1950ies and probably has not been run for almost 50 years now!

	I recently bought a digital satellite receiver, the great Topfield TF4000PVR. It is not the latest model
	but it offers a lot of features at a very low price. The Topfield can execute user-written
	plug-in programs, so-called TAPs (Topfield Application Programs). Of course, I immediately had to 
	try to create such a TAP, and I started with an Astro Fighter Emulator.

	<h3 id="2005_09_05">September 5, 2005: Asteroids in Java by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	After the first attempts with Tailgunner and Astro Fighter, I translated a real arcade classic to Java.
	It is Atari's great vector game Asteroids. Asteroids was originally written by Ed Logg of Atari Inc. in 1979,
	and it was the first arcade game I ever played (must have been back in 1980 :-).<br>
	My Java version was created twenty six years later by translating the program code,
	originally written for the 6502 CPU of the Asteroids machine, to Java.
	This translation was made by a Java program I wrote, which generates corresponding
	Java program code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations).
	<br>
	This project is open source and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your
	PC or website and with the complete source code in Java.

	<br>
	<br>



	<h3 id="2005_08_28">August 28, 2005: Astro Fighter in Java by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	The arcade game Astro Fighter was originally written by Data East Corporation (DECO) in 1980.
	Twenty five years later, I made an internet browser version of it by translating the Astro Fighter
	program code, originally written for the 6502 CPU of the Astro Fighter machine, to Java.
	The translation was made by a program, which generates	corresponding Java program code for
	each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques to the generated program

	<h3 id="2005_08_12">August 12, 2005: New Site Layout</h3>
	I made a new layout of my site. It uses frames now for the menu bar on the left-hand side, which
	makes navigation and maintainance easier.<br>
	In the last months I have been working on a static binary translator from 6502 machine language
	to Java and will present my first results soon. Stay tuned.

	<br>
	<br>


	<h3 id="2004_07_19">July 19, 2004: Tailgunner in Java by Static Binary Recompilation</h3>
	Today is my birthday and I can present a new program here :-). It is an exact port of the 25 year old
	classic arcade game "Tailgunner". I did this little project together with Graham Toal.<br>
	Tailgunner is a nice vector game made by Dan Sunday of the company Vectorbeam in 1979. Vectorbeam and
	the game were sold to Cinematronics later. Tailgunner was very advanced for its time. It is probably
	the first 3D vector game (older than Battlezone). This time the exact reproduction of the game is not
	achieved by a conventional CPU emulator, but by so-called static binary recompilation.
	<a href="http://www.gtoal.com" target="_blank">Graham Toal</a> wrote a really cool program, which can
	translate the original game code from C-CPU machine language to C. With Graham's help I ported his generated
	code to Java and added the graphical Java environment to play the game in an applet.
	Thank you Graham, it was a cool project :-)
	<br>
	The program is open source, and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your
	PC or website and with the complete Java source code.

	<h3 id="2002_01_26">January 26, 2002: NOSE, the SMS emulator, is online</h3>
	After a lot of arcade game emulators, I had to try something (slightly) different. I wrote an emulator for the
	Sega Master System (SMS) in Java which lets you play SMS games in your browser. The new emulator is called
	<a href="nose.html">NOSE</a>, Norbert's Online Sega Master System Emulator :-) It is based on JAE and ONE and
	offers the following features:
	<ul>
		<li>
		emulation of the Z80 CPU of the SMS
		<li>
		emulation of the Sega Video Display Processor (similar to Texas Instruments' TMS9918/9928)
		<li>
		emulation of the SN76496 sound chip made by Texas Instruments and used in the SMS
	</ul>
	NOSE will be improved in later versions and more games will be added. For the moment, I have only uploaded

	At last, I had a little time to work on a game, that I have been trying to emulate in JAE for a long time.
	Now I succeded to solve most of the problems I had with it. It is the excellent arcade version of 
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JATetris.html" target="_blank">Tetris</a>
	</ul>
	made by Atari Games in 1988. Some nice additions to the classic game idea and a huge number of different levels
	make this Tetris version one of the most enjoyables.<br>
	The emulator does not perfectly emulate all of the graphics, because the Tetris machine used
	a dynamic color pallette. To compensate for this, a real-time emulation of Atari's famous "Pokey" sound chip
	was added, so that you can listen to the cool russian-style tunes, that Tetris plays with its two Pokey chips.

	<a href="one.html">ONE</a> has a great new logo now! JoseQ, the famous webmaster of 
	<a href="http://www.emuviews.com/" target = "_blank">JoseQ's EmuViews</a>, 
	has designed it.<br>
	Thanks a lot for the perfect work, JoseQ!
	<p>
	My homepage has reached more than 100,000 visits. Wow!!
	When I started the page about a year ago with the first version of JAE, with AstDX, and with Vantris,
	I never would have thought, that this would ever be possible.<br>
	So it is time to say a big "Thank You" to all my visitors, to the emulation news reporters, and to
	the other emulator authors.<p>
	Enjoy the software provided here and have a Merry Christmas! Frohe Weihnachten! Feliz Navidad! Buon Natale!

        <li>
	A small bugfix for the
	<a href="one.html">Online NES Emulator (ONE)</a>
	has been made. Now the sound stops, when you close the browser window. Thanks to bwb for the bug
	report.<p>
	The next steps in ONE development will be a GUI and correct emulation of the background color.

        <li>
	<a href="one.html">ONE</a>,
	the Online NES Emulator is out
	<p> 
	The Online NES Emulator (ONE) has been released today. It is a new NES emu written in
	Java (on the basis of JAE). ONE lets you play NES games online in your browser window. 
	At the moment there is support for the memory mappers 0, 1, 2, and 3. The number of mappers
	and supported games will increase soon. 
	ONE also has sound support. The sound is produced by real-time emulation of the NES Audio Processing
	Unit. As this had to be done in Java, the sound quality unfortunately is rather bad.<p>

	I made a little selection of games, which already are playable with ONE. You can try them at the
	<a href="one.html">ONE</a> page.

	<h3 id="2000_11_18">November 18, 2000</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>
	There is a new addition to the Java Arcade Emulator. It is another Nintendo classic: 
	<a href="JMario.html" target = "_blank">Mario Bros.</a>
	This arcade game from 1983 was the starting point of the famous "Super Mario" series on the
	NES and	on the gameboy.
        Go to the

	<h3 id="2000_11_04">November 4, 2000</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>
	I added a new game to JAE, the Java Arcade Emulator. There was already a rumor in 
	<a href="http://www.emuviews.com/" target = "_blank">JoseQ</a>'s
	famous Rumor Mill about this. It is
	<a href="JDKong3.html" target = "_blank">Donkey Kong 3</a>,
	Nintendo's third part of the Donkey Kong trilogy.
        Go to the
	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a>
        section to read more and to play it online.</li><p>

        <li>
	I also made my second sound chip emulator in Java. It emulates the AY-8910 sound generator, a
	chip used in many arcade games of the eighties. The AY-8910 was also used for
	<ul>
	<li><a href="JBagman.html" target = "_blank">Bagman</a> and
	<li><a href="JSBagman.html" target = "_blank">Super Bagman</a>,
	</ul>
	which now have sound in JAE.<br>
        Try these two classics and enjoy their funny tunes by clicking on the above links, or via the
	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a> section.</li>
	</ul>


	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3 id="2000_10_28">October 28, 2000</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
	I made the first really emulated sound for the Java Arcade Emulator. The Namco sound chip in
	<ul>
	<li><a href="JPacman.html" target = "_blank">Pacman</a>,
	<li><a href="JMsPacman.html" target = "_blank">Ms. Pacman</a>, and
	<li><a href="JPengo.html" target = "_blank">Pengo</a>
	</ul>
	has been emulated. This time this was not done by only playing pre-recorded samples of the game, but by 
	constructing the sound for the Namco 3-voice sound generator in real-time. The result is terrible, when compared
	to MAME (due to the limitations of standard Java). But maybe I can somehow improve the concept.<br>
	Another problem is, that sound does not stop, after closing the browser window with the game. For the moment
	you have to close the browser completely. I am working on this.<br>
	Big thanks go to
	Peter Futerko for the support with the sound routines.
	I used his great ideas, although I had to apply a completely different technique at the end, because I did
	not want to use the non-standard Java features of javax.sound.<br>
        Now try these three classics with sound in the
	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a> section!</li>
    </ul>

	<h3 id="2000_10_11">October 11, 2000</h3>

	<li><a href="JPleiads.html" target = "_blank">Pleiads</a>,
