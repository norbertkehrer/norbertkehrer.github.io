                    <li>A new game is
                        available for JAE: Black Widow by Atari.</li>
                    <li>WIP for
                        Grav-A-Move, the Bust-A-Move for Gravitar hardware:
                        The first steps are taken (balls can be fired and
                        land on their final position), but there is still a
                        hard way to go.</li>
                    <li>I got some
                        feedback from guys trying to make a new skin for new
                        Asteroids - the results will be published here.</li>
