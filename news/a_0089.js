    `Static Binary Translation Talks at "Retropulsiv" in Augsburg and "Technologieplauscherl" in Linz`,
    `
            	It was a lot of fun for me to present some backgrounds of my static binary translations of Asteroids
            	(and 6502 machine language programs in general) in two really cool meetings. One was the great
            	<a href="http://www.hs-augsburg.de/retropulsiv/RETROpulsiv/Willkommen.html">Retropulsiv</a> in Augsburg
            	in Germany, and the second one was the highly interesting <a href="http://technologieplauscherl.at/">Technologieplauscherl</a> (technology chat) in Linz in Austria. Thanks a lot
            	to Chrisitian Krenner and Thorsten Sch&ouml;ler for organizing the Retropulsiv and to Domink Hurnaus and his colleagues
            	for organizing the Technologieplauscherl. They did a great job, and I really like these meetings, and I am already looking forward to
            	the next ones.

            	You can download my slides here and also the JavaScript "source code" I automatically generated out of the Asteroids ROM
            	(containing also my Asteroids DVG video hardware simulator):

            	You are strongly encouraged to try creating such translators and translations yourself (!), but please do not use my code
            	commercially and credit me in your non-commercial projects. I am also happy about feedback via
            	<a href="email.html">email</a>. Thank you.
