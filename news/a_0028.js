            	<a href="http://www.emuviews.com/" target = "_blank">JoseQ's EmuViews</a>, 
            	has designed it.<br>
            	Thanks a lot for the perfect work, JoseQ!
            	<p>
            	My homepage has reached more than 100,000 visits. Wow!!
            	When I started the page about a year ago with the first version of JAE, with AstDX, and with Vantris,
            	I never would have thought, that this would ever be possible.<br>
            	So it is time to say a big "Thank You" to all my visitors, to the emulation news reporters, and to
            	the other emulator authors.<p>
            	Enjoy the software provided here and have a Merry Christmas! Frohe Weihnachten! Feliz Navidad! Buon Natale!
