            	Version 1.2 of <a href="one.html">ONE</a>, the Online NES Emulator,
            	has been released. This version has support for Nintendo's MMC3 chip (Mapper #4). Although not yet perfect,
            	some games, which use the MMC3, have been added. For example
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            		Super Mario Bros. 2,
            		<li>
            		Super Mario Bros. 3 (!), and 
            		<li>
            		Tecmo Super Bowl (greetings to Jasen Brooks and all American Football fans).
            	</ul>
            	Go to the
            	<a href="one.html">ONE page</a> and play them online!
