    `Debugger for the Mailuefterl Emulator`,
    `
            	I added a simple debugger (well it's actually just a tracer) to my Mailuefterl emulator.
            	It allows to follow the execution of a program step by step. This is nice for Mailuefterl
            	programmers of the 21st century, the guys in the 1950ies of course had to make it without
            	such a tool.
            	<p>
            	I also included a little "hello world" program.
            	<p>
            	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try it.
