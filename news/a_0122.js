  "Infinite Scrolling on the Website",
  `
            I added infinite scrolling with JavaScript to my website. The articles in the News section are now incrementally loaded, when the user scrolls down.
            But all without using a dedicated program on the server, providing the contents, just with static pages, which are lazy-loaded.
            I also added a little self-written React-like framework, but without all the virtual-DOM stuff.
            <p>
           You should not notice anything&mdash;except the infinitely scrolling News section and maybe some bugs in my JavaScript code.
