    `IBM 5110 Emulator Now With Floppy Disk Support`,
    `
            	I added now support for floppy disk drives to the IBM 5110 emulator. Four
            	disks are linked: IBM's "Customer Support Functions", "Diagnostic Diskette", and
            	"Serial I/O Diskette", and an empty disk. Storing something to disk also works,
            	but it is lost, when you leave the browser. I still have to find some good
            	persistence model for JavaScript.
            	<p>
            	I am still looking for dumps of 5110 disks or tapes to add them also. If you happen to have such files
            	or old disks, please send me an <a href="email.html">email</a>.
