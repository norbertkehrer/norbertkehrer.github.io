  "Amstrad CPC Soundtrakker Player in JavaScript now with AY soundchip emulator",
  `
  <p>
  I replaced the simple oscillators in my little Soundtrakker player by Alexander Kovalenko's AY emulator. Thanks to BSC for the hint.
  It sounds much better now (at least on a fast computer).

  <p>
  If you want to try the new version with more than 300 cool CPC songs, just go to

  I also released the full source code here
