    `Asteroids in Java by Static Binary Translation`,
    `
            	After the first attempts with Tailgunner and Astro Fighter, I translated a real arcade classic to Java.
            	It is Atari's great vector game Asteroids. Asteroids was originally written by Ed Logg of Atari Inc. in 1979,
            	and it was the first arcade game I ever played (must have been back in 1980 :-).<br>
            	My Java version was created twenty six years later by translating the program code,
            	originally written for the 6502 CPU of the Asteroids machine, to Java.
            	This translation was made by a Java program I wrote, which generates corresponding
            	Java program code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
            	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations).
            	This project is open source and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your
            	PC or website and with the complete source code in Java.
            	Click <a href="sbt/Asteroids.html" target="_blank">here</a> to play Asteroids now.
            	Download the game from <a href="sbt/Asteroids.zip" target="_blank">here</a>, but please do not
            	forget to credit Atari for the original game and me for translating it to Java :-)
