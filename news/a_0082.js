    `MUPID talk at the VCFE`,
    `
            	I gave a talk about the Austrian videotex decoder and home computer MUPID II from 1984
            	at the <a href="http://www.vcfe.org" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe
            	(VCFE)</a> in Munich and also presented the machine there. I ported fig-FORTH and
            	CamelForth to the MUPID, and so I could also participate in the Forth Benchmark Contest held
            	every year at the VCFE.
            	<p>
            	The following picture shows my MUPID presented there:

            	All this was really great fun. Many thanks to all who attended my talk,
            	to Carsten Strotmann for organizing the extremely enjoyable Forth Benchmark Contest,
            	and above all to Hans Franke for inviting me and for organizing this great
            	Retro Computing festival every year!
