<h2>Tailgunner in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h2>

	Tailgunner is a nice vector game made by Dan Sunday of the company Vectorbeam in 1979.
	Vectorbeam and the game were sold to Cinematronics later. Tailgunner was very advanced
	for its time. It is probably the first 3D vector game (older than Battlezone).
	<p>
	This is an exact reproduction of the game, which is not achieved by a conventional CPU emulator,
	but by so-called static binary recompilation. Graham Toal wrote a really cool program, which can
	translate the original game code from C-CPU machine language to C. With Graham's help I ported his
	generated code to JavaScript and added the graphical HTML5/JavaScript environment to play the game
	in the browser. Thank you, Graham.
