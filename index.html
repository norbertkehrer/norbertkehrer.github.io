	<h3>January 12, 2019: Tailgunner in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	Fifteen years after a very nice little Java project, I now repeated the same exercise in JavaScript.
	It is an exact port of the 40 year old classic arcade game "Tailgunner", which I did together with Graham Toal.
	<p>
	Tailgunner is a vector game programmed by Dan Sunday of the company Vectorbeam in 1979. Vectorbeam and
	the game were sold to Cinematronics later. Tailgunner was very advanced for its time and is probably
	the first 3D vector game (older than Atari's Battlezone). This exact reproduction of the game was not
	achieved by a conventional CPU emulator, but by so-called static binary translation. Back in 2004,
	Graham Toal wrote a really cool program, with which he automatically
	translated the original game code from its specific CPU's machine language to C. With Graham's help I ported his generated
	C code first to Java, and now to JavaScript, and added a graphical HTML5/JavaScript environment in order to make
	the game playable in web browsers.
	<br>

	This is a screenshot to give you an impression of the game:

	<h3>January 1, 2019: Flashx20, the Epson HX-20 Floppy and Screen Emulator, now with Big Files</h3>
	I fixed a disk I/O bug in flashx20, my little program to simulate external floppy disk drives
	and an external	display controller for the Epson HX-20 handheld computer.
	<p>
	You can now from the HX-20 create and access files on the PC's hard disk of up to 8 Mbytes. The files
	are usable in random access mode using Disk Basic or machine language. You can directly access records
	of 128 bytes within such files by specifing their number (1-32767) in the GET or PUT command.
	<p>
	The new version can be downloaded as a zip file with examples and documentation here:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="flashx20/flashx20.zip">flashx20.zip</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Here is an example in Epson Disk Basic showing the file access capabilities with an 8 Mbyte file
	to give you an impression (also in the zip archive, to be loaded with LOAD "C:FILE8MB.ASC"):

	<h3>December 30, 2018: Youtube Video from Old Mailuefterl Talk (in German)</h3>
	There is an old audio recording of a talk about the Austrian "Mailuefterl" computer I gave ten years ago in German language on the
	<a href="http://www.vcfe.org/D/" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe</a> in Munich (May 1, 2009).
	I created a video out of that audio file by adding the slides I showed on the talk, and by replacing the live demo
	with my old Java-based emulator by a demo on my new JavaScript-based Mailuefterl emulator.
	<p>
	Here is the video:

	<h3>December 24, 2018: Flashx20, the Epson HX-20 Floppy and Screen Emulator, now has Graphics Support</h3>
	I now also added graphics support to flashx20, my little program to simulate external floppy disk drives
	and an external	display controller for the Epson HX-20 handheld computer.
	<p>
	The commands to draw dots and lines available in Epson BASIC can be used to create high-resolution
	pictures in up to 8 colors on the screen of a Windows PC connected to the HX-20. The graphics screen is
	shown in a separate window, so that the text display is still visible in the console.
	<p>
	The new version can be downloaded as a zip file containing the "flashx20" program for Windows computers,
	some BASIC examples and graphics demos to try, and the user manual as a pdf file. You can download the
	zip archive here:
	<ul>
        <li>
            <a href="flashx20/flashx20.zip">flashx20.zip</a>
        </li>
	</ul>
	I am still working on a Raspberry Pi version.
	<p>
	Here are two example screenshots showing the graphics capabilities (I did not wait for the Mandelbrot set
	calculation to finish, but took the screenshot after 3 hours of runtime ;-):

	<h3>December 15, 2018: Flashx20 &mdash; Floppy and Screen for the Epson HX-20</h3>
	The Epson HX-20 was a nice handheld computer back in the 1980ies. It has a small LCD screen and a micro cassette 
	drive built in, and it offers an interesting way to connect it with peripheral devices. The serial port at the
	back of the computer can talk to external hardware using an Epson-specific protocol for data exchange.
	<p>
	I happen to own an HX-20, and so I wrote the the program "flashx20" (for <u>FL</u>oppy <u>A</u>nd <u>S</u>creen for the <u>HX-20</u>). With flashx20 a normal
	Windows PC or notebook computer can be connected to the HX-20, and the PC simulates
	<ul>
		<li>
			an external display controller, and
		</li>
		<li>
			two external dual floppy disk drives (like e.g. the Epson TF-20).
		</li>
	</ul>
    The small built-in LCD screen of the HX-20 supports a resolution of only 4 x 20 characters in text mode or 32 x 120 pixels
	in graphics mode. This makes it cumbersome to edit large BASIC programs or text. Like a real display controller, flash20
	interprets the commands from the HX-20 and displays the corresponding text on the "big" screen of the PC. At the moment,
	flashx20 can only display text and has no graphics support yet.
    <p>
    Similarly, it is possible to connect up to four real floppy disk drives to the serial port of the Epson HX-20. There was
    e.g. Epson's dual disk drive called TF-20, which supported loading and saving of programs and data on floppy disks. When
    the TF-20 was connected during the boot-up of the HX-20, a special BASIC extension called "Disk BASIC" was loaded into
    the HX-20 and provided additional commands to work with floppy disks, e.g. the command "FILES" to display the disk directory.
    For the communication between the external floppy drive and the HX-20 a special protocol was used. Like in the real drives,
    the flashx20 program on the PC interprets this protocol and stores and loads programs and data from the HX-20 on the PC's
    hard disk.
    <p>
	I made a zip file containing my "flashx20" program for Windows computers, some BASIC examples to load via the PC, and a
	pdf manual. You can download it here:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="flashx20/flashx20.zip">flashx20.zip</a>
        </li>
	</ul>
	I am still working on a Raspberry Pi version and on the graphics support.
	<p>
	Here are some example screenshots:

	<h3>October 20, 2018: Zuse Z22 Emulator in JavaScript</h3>
	The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z22_(computer)">Z22</a> was a very early
	German computer based on vacuum tube technology. It was built by the
	company Zuse KG in 1958, which sold in total 55 machines to customers mainly in
	Germany. The machine was used for many applications in science, technology,
	and business. I wrote a Z22 emulator in Javascript, so you can try this historical computer
	directly in your web browser here:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="z22/z22.html" target="_blank">Start the Zuse Z22 Emulator</a>
	</ul>
	I wrote (very short) instructions on how to use the emulator. You find them in the "About"
	tab in the emulator or on
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="z22.html">my Zuse Z22 page</a>.
	</ul>
	Now try out software which was written 60 years ago and make new one!
	<p>
	Here are some screenshots of the emulator in action:

	<h3>September 5, 2018: Radar Rat Race Ported to the Atari 800XL</h3>
	I made a port of the old and very simple game
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Rat_Race" target="_blank">Radar Rat Race</a> to the Atari 800XL. It
	was originally written by the company Commodore back in 1982 for the Commodore 64. The
	game is based on Namco's arcade classic "Rally X", and, even if the game is so primitive, I liked to play it quite often
	on my C64 back in those days.
	<p>

	Similar to my former conversions, the original Commodore program is just running 1:1 on the Atari 800XL computer, which has the same CPU as the C64.
	The Commodore's graphics and sound effects were replaced by more or less equivalent Atari 800 XL routines. This port was really very easy.
	Contrary to the C64, the nerve-racking in-game music can be switched on and off in my Atari version by the "Option" key.
	<p>

	The program can be downloaded as an executable file here: <a href="rrr_a800/rrr.xex">rrr.xex</a>
	<p>

	It is also available as an atr file here: <a href="rrr_a800/rrr.atr">rrr.atr</a>
	<p>

	Here are two screenshots of the game on the Atari:

	<h3>February 4, 2018: Teletext Reader for the Commodore 64 - Update of File Naming and Page Format</h3>
	Thanks again to the feedback and testing of the colleagues at <a href="https://www.forum64.de" target="_blank">Forum 64</a>.
	Obviously, the SD2IEC version did not work with the file names with the ".prg" at the end. So, I went back to having only
	one version of the C64 reader. The program is now called "0teletext.prg", and it should work with the 1541 Ultimate
	and with SD2IEC (I hope).
	<p>
	I adapted the teletext mass download program, though, to have a second parameter to decide if the file naming should be for
	the 1541 Ultimate (with .prg) or for SD2IEC (without .prg). You can start the page mass download now with the first parameter being
	"orf1", "orf2", "orfiii", or "orfsportplus", respectively. The
	second parameter to be passed is now "1541u" or "sd2iec" to control the format of the generated C64 file names.
	<p>
	The updated program can be downloaded as a zip file here: <a href="teletext_c64/teletext.zip">teletext.zip</a>.
	<p>
	If the new version does not work on your machine, I left the old version as a fallback here:
	<a href="teletext_c64/teletext_old.zip">teletext_old.zip</a>.
	<p>
	In case, you want to write your own page downloader for you favorite TV station's teletext, here is the format
	of the pages expected by the C64 reader program. You might also find it interesting to generate text from other sources, of course.
	I would be happy to hear from your efforts. Please just drop me an <a href="email.html">email</a>.
	The format of the files you have to generate is the following:
	<p>
	<pre>
        Position (hex)    Contents
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        $0000-$0001       Load address (low byte/high byte). Always has to be
                          0x00/0x40 (i.e. address $4000).

        $0002-$03c1       40 x 24 bytes for the text of the page (ASCII and
                          special characters).

        $03c2             Separator. Always has to be 0x00.

        $03c3-$0782       40 x 24 bytes for color and width/height information
                          for each character of the teletext page. The 8 bits
                          of each byte are interpreted as "hfffwbbb", with:
                          h   ... Double height indicator (0=normal, 1=double)
                          fff ... Text color in C64 color code format (0-7)
                          w   ... Double width indicator (0=normal, 1=double)
                          bbb ... Background color in C64 color code format (0-7)
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
	</pre>

	<h3>January 29, 2018: Teletext Reader for the Commodore 64 - now with Mass Downloader for All ORF Channels</h3>
	Thanks to the great feedback and testing of the colleagues at <a href="https://www.forum64.de" target="_blank">Forum 64</a>
	I could fix some bugs and make my teletext reader usable for SD2IEC and also for 1541 Ultimate. The version for
	SD2IEC is called "0teletext.prg" now, and the one working with a 1541 Ultimate is called "0teletextu.prg".
	<p>
	I also extended my teletext mass download program to be able to download also the teletext pages of the ORF channels
	ORF 2, ORF iii, and ORF Sport +. You have to start the page download now with "teletext_orf orf1", "teletext_orf orf2",
	"teletext_orf orfiii", or "teletext_orf orfsportplus", respectively.  
	<p>
	The updated program can be downloaded as a zip file here: <a href="teletext_c64/teletext.zip">teletext.zip</a>.

	<h3>January 28, 2018: Teletext Reader for the Commodore 64</h3>
	At a Commodore meeting in Vienna a visitor said, that it would be nice to read teletext pages on a Commodore 64.
	I thought so too, and wrote a teletext reader, but probably based on a different concept, than originally imagined
	by that C64 fan. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext" target="_blank">Teletext</a> is made up of
	(almost pure) text pages with 24 lines and 40 columns, and it is broadcast by many TV stations via the television signal
	in the so-called vertical blanking interval lines. The contents offered in these pages are mainly news, weather,
	TV schedules, etc.
	<p>
	To read the teletext pages on a Commodore 64 you would have to build some hardware to extract the data from
	the TV signal and feed it into the C64. This would also be a really interesting Retro project in itself, but for
	my simple reader I used an alternative method. Many TV stations offer their teletext contents also on their
	web sites for reading them in the browser. So, I wrote a C program to download all the teletext pages of a specific
	TV station (at the moment only the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, ORF) to your Windows PC and convert them
	into files readable by my C64 teletext reader program. Each teletext page will then become one file for the C64.
	You can then copy all these files and the reader program to an SD card and take your time to read them on
	the Commodore. The pages are identified by 3-digit numbers, which you can enter in the C64 reader and select
	the page with the "Return" key. The function keys offer some simple navigation functions, like going back to
	the last page, etc.
	<p>
	I have to admit, that I have no SD card interface for my Commodore 64, so I could only test it in the emulator.
	I am hoping for your feedback, if this really works on real hardware. Please send me an <a href="email.html">email</a>.
	At the moment, I have only a downloader for the ORF, but the next step would be to add more TV stations, e.g., the
	German ARD and ZDF teletext offerings.
	<p>
	The program can be downloaded as a zip file here: <a href="teletext_c64/teletext.zip">teletext.zip</a>.
	<p>
	The archive contains a Windows program you just run on the Windows command line. It will then download and convert
	all the "ORF eins" teletext pages to a C64 readable format and store them as files (more than 4,000!) in a directory
	called "pages". This takes about 5 to 10 minutes. Then the teletext reader program for the Commodore 64 is copied
	to this "pages" directory also, and you are ready to take this whole directory over to your Commodore 64, e.g. on an
	SD card.

	<h3>August 31, 2017: Floating Point Library for the Mailuefterl Computer and More Original Mailuefterl Programs</h3>
	Almost all original software for the Austrian pioneering computer Mailuefterl seems to be lost now.
	This is really a pity. I found some pieces of original Mailuefterl code in the diploma thesis of the late
	<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lucas_(Informatiker)" target="_blank">Peter Lucas</a>, one
	of the members of the Mailuefterl team. Peter wrote about computer programming, which was
	a completely new field of knowledge back in 1959. He shows structured ways of programming using several
	instructive examples like a sine function implemented via Taylor series, or square root calculation with Newton's
	method, or matrix multiplication, etc. In the appendix of his diploma thesis Peter Lucas added the code listings
	of these examples in Mailuefterl assembly language. Unfortunately, the programs use a floating point library,
	which was also written by Peter Lucas as part of his diploma thesis, but for which the code listing was not
	included. So, in order to be able to run Peter's example programs in my Mailuefterl emulator, I had to rewrite
	the floating point operations from scratch on my own. I implemented addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
	and printing of floating point numbers. My code is certainly not as elegant as Peter's original, but it seems to
	work, and so Peter Lucas' original programs from 1959 can be tried out still today. I also could find and correct some bugs
	in my emulator during this interesting exercise.
	<p>

	You can try Peter's programs and my floating point routines directly in your internet browser
	here:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="mailuefterl/mailuefterl.html" target="_blank">Start the Mailuefterl Emulator</a>
	</ul>
	The exact reference of the diploma thesis (in German) is:<br>
	Lucas P.: "Zur Programmierung elektronischer Rechenmaschinen",
	Staatspruefungsarbeit am Institut fuer Nachrichtentechnik II der
	Technischen Hochschule Wien, Vienna, October 1959.
	<br>
	The  title translates to "On the programming of electronic calculating machines".
	<p>
	Here is a screenshot with a little demo program using Peter's sine function:

	<h3>July 10, 2017: Mailuefterl Emulator in JavaScript</h3>
	The Mailuefterl (German for "may breeze", an allusion to much bigger US computers
	like "Whirlwind" or "Typhoon") was the first fully transistorized computer
	in Europe. It was built at the 
	Technical University of Vienna (Austria) from 1955 to 1958 by Dr. Heinz Zemanek and his team.
	In 2007 I wrote an emulator for this pioneering machine as a Java applet, which does not
	work any more on modern browsers. So, ten years later, it was really high time for a port to
	JavaScript. You can now again try this historical computer directly in your internet browser
	here:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="mailuefterl/mailuefterl.html" target="_blank">Start the Mailuefterl Emulator</a>
	</ul>
	I also wrote short instructions on how to use the emulator, and I summarized the complete
	instruction set of the machine on
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a>.
	</ul>
	Go there to read more and to try out software which was written in the 1950ies and probably has
	not been run for almost 60 years now!

	<h3>December 1, 2016: Phoenix Emulator for the Amstrad CPC</h3>
	I recently bought an Amstrad CPC on the flea market. The machine was called Schneider CPC
	in Austria and Germany, and it is a nice Z80-based home computer from the early eighties.
	So, I really had to try to program it in its machine language and wrote an emulator
	of the classic arcade game Phoenix from 1980. The original arcade machine was made by the
	American company Amstar (sounds a little bit like Amstrad, doesn't it) and had a 8085 CPU.
	So, the Amstrad CPC can directly run the original game program on its 8085-compatible Z80 CPU. 
	To emulate the arcade machine's video and sound hardware on the Amstrad home computer
	I wrote specific Z80 routines. These are still a little bit buggy now.
	I made two versions. One with sixteen colors but lower resolution, and a second one with the original
	resolution but with only four colors.
	<p>
	Here are two videos of the emulator in action:
	<p>

	<p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gcZrdL7Eeuc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


	<p>
	Go to <a href="phoenix_cpc.html">my CPC Phoenix Emulator page</a> to read more about the emulator
	and to download it.

	<p>
	Or download the Amstrad CPC disk file right from here: <a href="phoenix_cpc/phoenix.dsk">phoenix.dsk</a>

	<p>

	You can use this file with a CPC emulator or put it on a floppy disk or on tape and play it on the real machine.
	The disk image contains two files. Run the file "phoenix" for the 16-color version with lower resolution, or
	alternatively run the file "phoenixh" for the 4-color version with high resolution.

	<h3>April 18, 2016: BTX-Server to connect your old Videotex terminal to the PC</h3>

	In Austria and Germany there was in the 1980s a Videotex system called "BTX" or
	"Bildschirmtext" (German for "screen text").
	I wrote a little server in JavaScript, which lets you connect your old Videotex
	decoders to a PC. With that, you can call up old Videotex pages stored as files on your
	PC and view them on the decoder.

	<p>
	Here is the server in action showing an old German BTX page on my Mupid, a cool
	Austrian Videotex decoder from the eighties:
	<p>
	<img src="media/Mupid_BTX_2016.jpg" alt="Norbert Kehrer's Mupid with a BTX page">

	<p>
	And here is the BTX server software as a zip file for download: <a href="btx_server/btx_server.zip">btx_server.zip</a>

	<p>
	Installation and usage instructions are included in the zip file.
	The software is still at a very early stage and still buggy, but you can call up a BTX
	page via *page# like back the old days. So, there is more to come ...

	<p>
	If you are a lucky Mupid owner, try out my Forth interpreter for that decoder (actually a FIG Forth port). 
	Start the BTX server, change to the forth directory with "cd forth", press the blue "K"
	and then "A" on the Mupid, and then call up the BTX page with "*mupidforth#". After some loading you have the
	old interactive programming language Forth available for your own Mupid experiments.

	<h3>February 5-6, 2016: The 'LineTo' Bug. A little Game Jam Entry</h3>
	For the first time, I attended a Game Jam. It was held at the at the University of
	Applied Sciences in Salzburg, and you
	had 36 hours to write a game on the topic "It's a feature, not a bug".
	This was really great fun and perfectly organized by Florian Jindra and team. Thank you!
	<p>

	I wrote a little (boring) browser game based on a programmer's bug in drawing a square, where the postioning of the
	square was done using a 'LineTo' command instead of a 'MoveTo'. This results in a constantly drawn
	line from the coordinate system's origin to the square you control with the cursor keys.
	The target is to collect all the green squares while avoiding red bullets flying around.
	<p>

	You can try the game directly in your browser clicking here:

	<h3>October 3, 2015: Sprint 1 Ported to the Commodore 64</h3>
	After the conversion for the Atari 800XL, I now made also a port of the old, but very nice car-racing game
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_2" target="_blank">Sprint</a> to the Commodore 64. The
	original game was written by Atari back
	in 1976 (Sprint 2 for two players) and in 1978 (Sprint1 for one player).
	<p>

	I ported the game to the Commodore 64 computer by just running the orignal arcade game program
	on the home computer. The arcade machine's video and sound hardware are emulated by specific C64 routines.
	In the home computer version the game has to be played with the joystick instead of the original's steering, gearshift,
	and accelerator pedal.
	<p>

	The game can be downloaded as an PRG file here: <a href="sprint_c64/sprint1.prg">sprint1.prg</a>
	<p>

	Below you see some screenshots of the running game:

	<h3>September 7, 2015: Sprint 1 Ported to the Atari 800XL</h3>
	Similar to my conversion of Asteroids, I made a port of the old, but very nice car-racing game
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_2" target="_blank">Sprint</a>, which
	was originally written by Atari back
	in 1976 (Sprint 2 for two players) and in 1978 (Sprint1 for one player), respectively.
	<p>

	I ported the game to the Atari 800XL computer by just running the orignal arcade game program
	on the Atari. The arcade machine's video and sound hardware are emulated by specific Atari 800 XL routines.
	In the homecomputer version the game has to be played with the joystick instead of the original's steering, gearshift,
	and accelerator pedal.

	The program can be downloaded as an executable file here: <a href="sprint_a800/sprint1.xex">sprint1.xex</a>

	<h3>August 2, 2015: Sprint in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation (now also in 3D ;-)</h3>
	I made another static binary translation of a 6502 CPU-based arcade game to JavaScript.
	It is the old, but very nice car-racing game
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_2" target="_blank">Sprint</a>, which
	was originally written by Atari back
	in 1976 (Sprint 2 for two players) and in 1978 (Sprint1 for one player), respectively.
	<p>
	The JavaScript code was automatically translated from the original game's program code. A Prolog
	program generates semantically equivalent JavaScript code for each 6502 instruction and applies some
	optimization techniques to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations). The outcome is
	an exact simulation of the original arcade game. The graphics interface and the emulation of the Sprint video hardware
	were directly coded in JavaScript and rely on HTML5 and the Canvas element.
	<p>
	The video hardware of the old arcade machine was only capable of showing very simple 2D character-based
	playfield graphics with four moving objects (sprites). Today's car-driving games normally have 3D graphics, so I
	thought it would be nice to have a 3D interface also for Sprint. I wrote an alternative video hardware
	simulator for Sprint, where the same video RAM and sprite hardware registers, which the original Sprint video circuitry
	shows as simple 2D character graphics, are interpreted as coordinates and objects in
	three-dimensional space. The orignal game, in which you take a bird's eye view
	of the race track, becomes a 3D game seen from the first-person perspective of the driver's seat. But keep in mind, that it is
	still the completely same game logic and the same program from 1976 running, just graphically interpreted differently!
	<p>
	My 3D modelling and programming skills (and also my computer's graphics card speed) are quite limited, so my 3D version is
	very simple and still suffers from - what I think are - bugs in the (apart from that, really great)
	Three.js JavaScript 3D library. So, please consider this just a proof of concept.
	<p>
	<a href="sprint_js/SprintJS.html" target="_blank">Now, click here to try Sprint directly in your browser.</a>.
	It is an arcade game, so don't forget to insert coins first by pressing the "5" key, and then start it with the "1" key.
	<p>
	Here are example screenshots for the original and the 3D version:

	<h3>June 24, 2015: Static Binary Translation Talks at the "vienna.js" Meetup in Vienna</h3>
	It was a lot of fun for me to present some backgrounds of my static binary translations of old 6502-based arcade games
	in the really cool monthly meetup of the Vienna JavaScript User Group
	called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/de/viennajs/" target="_blank">vienna.js</a>. Thanks a lot to all the visitors
	and to Roland Sch&uuml;tz for organizing it so perfectly and for inviting me.

	<p>
	You can download my slides here:
	<a href="http://de.slideshare.net/norbert_kehrer/static-binary-translationjsmeetupslides" target="_blank">Static Binary Translation of 6502 Arcade Games</a>

	<p>
	You can try the translated games here:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="ast_js/AsteroidsJS.html" target="_blank">Asteroids (Atari, 1979)</a>
	<li><a href="centipede_js/CentipedeJS.html" target="_blank">Centipede (Atari, 1981)</a>
	<li><a href="astrof_js/AstrofJS.html" target="_blank">Astro Fighter (Data East, 1980)</a>
	</ul>		

	<p>
	I hope, at least some of you got interested in trying such a translation also. I found it very exciting
	and surprisingly challenging. You can practice and learn something about code generation and optimization,
	and at the same time you get a video game.

	<h3>June 19, 2015: IBM 5110 Emulator Now With Floppy Disk Support</h3>
	I added now support for floppy disk drives to the IBM 5110 emulator. Four
	disks are linked: IBM's "Customer Support Functions", "Diagnostic Diskette", and
	"Serial I/O Diskette", and an empty disk. Storing something to disk also works,
	but it is lost, when you leave the browser. I still have to find some good
	persistence model for JavaScript.
	<p>
	I am still looking for dumps of 5110 disks or tapes to add them also. If you happen to have such files
	or old disks, please send me an <a href="email.html">email</a>.

	<br>

	<h3>May 25, 2015: IBM 5110 Emulator in JavaScript</h3>
	The IBM 5100 and 5110 were IBM's first "portable" computers. They had interpreters 
	of the machine languages of IBM's much bigger machines System/3 and System/360 in their ROMs,
	and so this small computer could execute (slightly adapted) BASIC and APL language
	implementations of the large machines. The IBM 5110 was the first "real" computer I worked
	on. We had one in our school, and many thanks go to my physics and to my chemistry teacher
	for letting us work on this (for me) mega-expensive machine in school back in the early eighties.
	There was no dedicated computer science course at our school,
	but the two teachers showed us how the 5110 can be used to solve physics and chemistry problems and 
	introduced us to the fascinating world of computer programming.
	<p>
	I now wrote a JavaScript emulator of the IBM 5110 to be used directly in the web browser.
	It is a port of
	<a href="http://computermuseum.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/dev_en/ibm_5110/ibm_5110.html" target="_blank">Christian Corti</a>'s
	great emulator, which he wrote for Unix systems. There are probably still some bugs and issues with the keyboard mapping,
	and disk and tape support are still missing. I am working on it, though, and I am looking for dumps of 5110 disks or tapes
	to use as test cases. If you happen to have such files, please send me an <a href="email.html">email</a>.

	<h3>April 2, 2015: Centipede in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	I made another static binary translation of a 6502-based arcade game to JavaScript.
	It is the great game Centipede, which was originally written by Atari back in 1980.
	<p>
	The translation was automatized by my Prolog program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations). The outcome is
	an exact simulation of the original arcade game.
	The graphics interface and the emulation of the Centipede video hardware
	were directly coded in JavaScript and rely on HTML5 and the Canvas element.
	So you should have a quite recent browser version supporting these features to be able to play the game.
	<p>
	If you are interested in the technique I used for the automatic translation and the highly
	interesting challenges I faced in this process, come and visit the great
	<a href="http://www.vcfe.org" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe (VCFE)</a>
	in Munich fom May 1 to May 3, 2015. I will give a talk there on the project, and would be
	happy to meet you, discuss it, and have fun.

	<h3>March 3, 2015: Astro Fighter in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	I continued my experiments with static binary translation of 6502-based arcade games and 
	translated the 1980 game Astro Fighter to JavaScript.
	<p>
	The arcade game Astro Fighter was originally written by Data East Corporation (DECO) in 1980.
	It was one of the first arcade games I ever played, though the version
	we had in our pub was called Astro Wars (a remake based on a Signetics 2650 CPU by
	the Italian company Zaccaria).
	<p>
	The translation was automatized by a Prolog program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations). The outcome is
	an exact simulation of the original arcade game.
	The graphics interface and the emulation of the Astro Fighter video hardware
	were directly coded in JavaScript and rely on HTML5 and the Canvas element.
	So you should have a quite recent browser version supporting these features to be able to play the game.

	<h3>November 26, 2014: Static Binary Translation Talks at "Retropulsiv" in Augsburg and "Technologieplauscherl" in Linz</h3>
	It was a lot of fun for me to present some backgrounds of my static binary translations of Asteroids
	(and 6502 machine language programs in general) in two really cool meetings. One was the great
	<a href="http://www.hs-augsburg.de/retropulsiv/RETROpulsiv/Willkommen.html">Retropulsiv</a> in Augsburg
	in Germany, and the second one was the highly interesting <a href="http://technologieplauscherl.at/">Technologieplauscherl</a> (technology chat) in Linz in Austria. Thanks a lot
	to Chrisitian Krenner and Thorsten Sch&ouml;ler for organizing the Retropulsiv and to Domink Hurnaus and his colleagues
	for organizing the Technologieplauscherl. They did a great job, and I really like these meetings, and I am already looking forward to
	the next ones.

	<h3>November 6, 2014: Hewlett-Packard Calculator Emulators for the Atari 800XL now with two "Colors"</h3>
	The Atari 800XL versions of my HP calculator emulators only had a black-and-white screen up to now.
	Thanks to ClausB from the AtariAge board for pointing out the method to use player-missile graphics
	to produce another "color" (dark grey), and very special thanks to Adam Wachowski for explaining me so
	patiently how this really works on the Atari. For a guy like me, who "grew up" with a C64, the way
	the 8-bit Atari's video hardware works still seems a little bit strange.  

	<p>

	<h3>October 25, 2014: Hewlett-Packard Calculator Emulators for the Atari 800XL and for the Commodore 64</h3>
	In 1972 the great American company Hewlett-Packard shipped their first pocket calculator.
	It was called HP-35, and it was the first pocket calculator with transcendental functions
	and the first with the so-called Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
	The HP-35 was a huge success with scientific/engineering users, so HP soon came out with
	a similar model for business users. It was called HP-80, and could solve problems like
	present and future values of payment streams, trend line calculations (least squares
	linear regression), ammortization, date calculation, etc.
	Hewlett-Packard continued with the HP-45, an improved scientific model (which I
	happen to own :-), and (after the models 65 and 70) with the HP-55, which was programmable
	and supported a quartz-controlled stopwatch function.
	These (so-called "classic") calculators of HP were based upon a proprietary 4-bit CPU
	developed just for that purpose.
	<p>
	I now wrote emulators for these four calculators for the Atari 800XL and for the Commodore 64,
	which simulate the HP calculator CPU to interpret the original program ROMs of the four models.
	This enables you to work with your Atari 800 or C64 exactly like with the great classic HP
	calculators with their sophisticated scientific and business functions.

	<h3>October 11, 2014: Hewlett-Packard 45 Calculator in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	The Hewlett-Packard 45 is a great calculator. It was introduced in 1973
	and was HP's second scientific calculator.
	<p>
	This JavaScript version was created more than 40 years later by the method of static binary translation.
	That means, that the calculator's program code originally written in the machine language of HP's special 4-bit CPU
	used in the HP-45 was converted one-to-one to JavaScript.
	The translation was automatized by a JavaScript program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each CPU instruction. The outcome is an exact simulation of the original HP-45 calculator.

	<h3>September 15, 2014: Asteroids 8-bit Emulation Paper in "Shift - Restore - Escape" Conference Proceedings</h3>
	I had the honor to give a talk at Stefan H&ouml;ltgen's great series of retrocomputing lectures "Shift - Restore - Escape",
	which he organized at the renowned Humboldt University in Berlin in 2013. I spoke about my emulators
	of the "Asteroids" arcade game on the vintage home computers Commodore 64, Atari 800XL, Commodore 128,
	and Commodore Plus/4, and it was really great, great fun. Stefan asked the speakers to write papers about
	their talks, and he compiled a superb book in German language called
	"Shift - Restore - Escape, Retrocomputing und Computerarch&auml;ologie" out of that.
	<p>
	Today, this book, which is in a way the "Conference Proceedings" of Stefan H&ouml;ltgen's lecture series, was published by
	the "CSW | Verlag", which is very well known for its numerous retrocomputing and retrogaming titles.
	<p>
	The book contains a fantastic selection of contributions to the modern retrocomputing scene and community, and also my
	paper titled "Asteroids auf 8-Bit-Heimcomputern, Portierung des Spielautomatenklassikers". I think the book is a must-have
	for every German-speaking retrocomputing fan.

	<h3>June 6, 2014: Asteroids in JavaScript by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	I wanted to learn something about making games in JavaScript based on HTML5 and its
	Canvas element and tried to redo a Java project of mine from almost ten years ago in JavaScript now.
	<p>
	I translated Atari's great vector arcade game Asteroids to JavaScript.
	Asteroids was originally written by Ed Logg of Atari Inc. in 1979, and 
	my JavaScript version was created by applying the method of static binary translation to Ed's code.
	That means, that the program code originally written in the machine language of the 6502 CPU
	of the Asteroids machine was converted in a one-to-one manner to JavaScript.
	The translation was automatized by a Java program, which generates semantically equivalent
	JavaScript code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations). The outcome is
	an exact simulation of the original, first Asteroids game.
	<p>
	The graphics interface and the emulation of the Asteroids arcade machine's vector generator hardware
	were directly coded in JavaScript and rely on HTML5 and the Canvas element.
	So you should have a quite recent browser version supporting these features to be able to play the game.

	<h3>May 4, 2014: MUPID talk at the VCFE</h3>
	I gave a talk about the Austrian videotex decoder and home computer MUPID II from 1984
	at the <a href="http://www.vcfe.org" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe
	(VCFE)</a> in Munich and also presented the machine there. I ported fig-FORTH and
	CamelForth to the MUPID, and so I could also participate in the Forth Benchmark Contest held
	every year at the VCFE.
	<p>
	The following picture shows my MUPID presented there:

	<h3>December 29, 2013: Galaga for the Atari 800</h3>
	In 1982 the German programmer Henrik Wening made a great version of the arcade game Galaga for
	the Commodore PET computer. The PET, being more a business-oriented computer, had only 
	very limited graphics and sound capabilities. So the game is graphically very simple but the
	gameplay is great. There was also a version of it for the Commodore 64, which I
	loved to play back in the eighties. You can read more on the original PET Galaga
	version on <a href="http://www.wening.de/" target="_blank">Henrik's homepage</a>
 	(in German).

	<p>

	I now ported Henrik's great game to the Atari 800XL computer.
	<p>

	Here is a screenshot of the result:

	<h3>July 12, 2013: Atari Calculator for the Commodore 64</h3>
	In 1979 Atari shipped a program called "Atari Calculator" for the Atari 800 computers.
	It provides the functionality of powerful, programmable scientific and financial calculators
	on the Atari home computer. I heard an interesting talk on it given by Roland B. Wassenberg on
	the Vintage Computer Festival 2013 in Munich, got interested, and now ported this program
	to the Commodore 64.
	<p>

	Here is a screenshot of the result (note the Atari font ;-):

	<h3>March 18, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - C128 Bug Fix</h3>
	There was a bug in the Asteroids Emulator, which made it slower when run on the C128. This was fixed and
	hopefully it is fine now. Thanks to tokra, WTE, and Alan Reed for bug reporting and testing on the real machine.
	<p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>March 17, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Another Little Speed Increase</h3>
	I made one more little speed optimization of the Asteroids emulator for the Commodore 64. It is noticeable especially
	when many objects are on the screen. This, I think, is now the last update of the C64 version for the moment.
	<p>

	Go to my <a href="astc64.html">Commodore 64 Asteroids Emulator page</a> to download the new version, or just

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>March 16, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore Plus/4</h3>
	I ported my Asteroids Emulator for the C64 to the Commodore Plus/4. The conversion was quite an interesting
	task. The Plus/4 is similar but faster than the C64 due to the automatic switch to a higher clock 
	frequency, whenever the raster beam is in the screen border or in VBLANK. Sound in the emulator is rather
	poor, though, due to the limited capabilities of the Plus/4's TED chip.
	<p>

	get the new program file here: <a href="astplus4/astplus4.prg">astplus4.prg</a>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>March 6, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Fast Mode on the C128</h3>
	Here is another update of the Asteroids Emulator for the C64. The program now checks, if it is running on a C128
	in C64 mode, and in that case it switches to the 2 MHz clock frequency, when the raster beam is in the border.
	This method allows a speedup of approximately 30% compared to the genuine C64 and results in smoother movements
	in the game.
	<p>

	Go to my <a href="astc64.html">Commodore 64 Asteroids Emulator page</a> to download the new version, or just

	<br>

	<h3>March 2, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Speed Increase</h3>
	I received more positive feedback in the last days. Many thanks again to all of you.
	I made a further little speed optimization of the Asteroids emulator, and it should be faster now especially when more
	objects are on the screen.
	<p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>February 28, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Now also for the SuperCPU</h3>
	I made now also a version of the Asteroids emulator for a C64 with the SuperCPU (20 MHz 6510-compatible processor) for the
	lucky ones who own such a device. I do not have one, so I could only test the program in the emulator. With
	this massive boost in computing power the game runs quite smoothly.

	<h3>February 26, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64 - Improved Sound</h3>
	Thanks to all the people interested in this program for their nice feedback in the last days.
	I now improved the sound of the Asteroids emulator (especially the saucers) and
	also could find a possibility for a small speedup (a little bit more to come hopefully).
	<p>

	<h3>February 23, 2013: Asteroids Emulator for the Commodore 64</h3>
	I did now the same exercise on the Commodore 64 as on the Atari 800XL a few months ago and
	wrote an emulator of Atari's classic 1979 arcade game "Asteroids" running on the C64.
	In the Asteroids emulator the "emulation" of the arcade machine's CPU is performed by the 6510 processor of
	the C64 itself, i.e. the original arcade program is directly executed on the home computer.
	The sophisticated video and sound hardware of the arcade machine is simulated by my Asteroids
	emulator program. The C64&#8212;due to its lower clock frequency&#8212;is slower than the Atari 800XL
	and has a more complex graphics representation. So, the challenge to make the emulator more or less
	fast enough on this small 8-bit home computer was really a big one for me.
	<p>
	Here is now a video of the emulator in action:

	<h3>November 3, 2012: Asteroids Emulator for the Atari 800XL</h3>
	For the <a href="http://www.abbuc.de" target="_blank">
	ABBUC Software Contest 2012</a> I wrote an emulator of Atari's classic arcade game "Asteroids" from
	1979 which runs on the Atari 800XL. My program was placed third in the contest with very strong
	competitors, who all submitted really great new software for the old Atari 8-bit home computers.
	So I am very happy to be among the three best and would like to thank Sascha and the rest of the
	ABBUC team for organizing this great contest. Thanks also to Peter Dell for the discussions and for the
	cool WUDSN IDE, to Carsten Strotmann for his support and the discussions, and to all the ABBUC members
	for testing and voting for my program.

	In the Asteroids emulator the "emulation" of the arcade machine's CPU is done by the 6502 processor of
	the 8-bit Atari itself, i.e. the original arcade program is directly executed on the home computer.
	The sophisticated video and sound hardware of the arcade machine is simulated by my Asteroids
	emulator program. The biggest challenge in this project was to make the emulator fast enough on the
	small Atari computer, which is probably less (!) powerful than the emulated arcade machine.
	<p>
	Here is a video of the emulator:

	<h3>November 1, 2011: PDP-8 Emulator for the Atari 800XL</h3>
	For the <a href="http://www.abbuc.de/index.php/de/atari/software-ressort/101-software-contest-2011" target="_blank">
	ABBUC Software Contest 2011</a> I wrote an emulator of DEC's PDP-8 minicomputer from 1965 which
	runs on the Atari 800XL. The program surprisingly was placed fifth in the contest, which I am very
	happy about. Many thanks to Bunsen, Carsten, and the rest of the ABBUC team for their support and
	for organizing this unique contest. Thanks also to all the ABBUC members for testing and voting for
	my program.
	<p>
	The Atari PDP-8 emulator can run PDP-8 binary programs on an Atari 800XL. It simulates the machine
	instructions and the teletype of an original machine with 16k words of main memory. The emulator
	has been successfully tested with PDP-8 software from the sixties and seventies like CHEKMO-II,
	the chess program, or the programming languages FOCAL and LISP.
	<p>
	You can watch a video of the emulator running the chess programm CHEKMO-II here (thanks to Thorsten for recording it):

	<h3>May 16, 2010: YM-64, my YM music player for the Commodore 64</h3>
	YM-64 is a program to play so-called ym files on the Commodore 64.
	Ym files usually contain music written for the Atari ST,
	the Amstrad/Schneider CPC, or the Sinclair ZX spectrum. YM-64 emulates the YM2149
	sound chip used in that computers and by that makes it possible to play their
	music also on Commodore 64 computers.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="ym64.html">my YM-64 page</a> to download many YM files converted to C64
	programs and to try them on an emulator or on the real hardware. Additionally, all the programs
	are available in the popular sid file format.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>September 6, 2009: My C64 Programs from the Eighties</h3>
	My first own computer was a Commodore 64. I bought it in June 1984 together with a Datasette
	and a joystick and did quite a lot of programming on it from the beginning. Now I managed
	to transfer two of my old C64 programs to the PC with a self-built XE1541 cable. They are
	from 1988 and 1989 and are called "Snake" (a Nibbler clone) and "Tetris" (nomen est omen).
	<p>
	Go to <a href="c64.html">my C64 page</a> to download them and try them on the emulator or
	on the real hardware.

	<h3>May 1, 2009: Mailuefterl talk at the VCFE</h3>
	I gave a talk about the history and technical aspects of the Mailuefterl computer
	at the <a href="http://www.vcfe.org" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival Europe
	(VCFE)</a> in Munich and also showed my emulator there.
	<p>
	This was really great fun. Many thanks to all the participants in my presentation
	and above all to Hans Franke for inviting me and for organizing this great
	Retro Computing festival every year!
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>



	<h3>November 27, 2008: Debugger for the Mailuefterl Emulator</h3>
	I added a simple debugger (well it's actually just a tracer) to my Mailuefterl emulator.
	It allows to follow the execution of a program step by step. This is nice for Mailuefterl
	programmers of the 21st century, the guys in the 1950ies of course had to make it without
	such a tool.
	<p>
	I also included a little "hello world" program.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try it.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>November 8, 2008: Prime Number Generator for the Mailuefterl</h3>
	I wrote another little demo program for the Mailuefterl. It is a simple prime number generator.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try it on my emulator.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>November 1, 2008: Improvements in the Mailuefterl Emulator</h3>
	Last week, I had a really interesting discussion with leading members of the
	Austrian Computer Society and got some very good feedback on possible improvements in the
	user interface of my Mailuefterl Emulator. Based on that, I changed the multi-window oriented
	structure of the user interface to a single-window view, to make the use of the program
	less confusing. The different I/O devices of the Mailuefterl will now be shown alternatingly
	in one window. I also removed the flickering of the blinkenlights display and added another
	little Mailuefterl program, which prints out the squares of integers.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out the improved version.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>February 21, 2007: Mailuefterl Emulator with More Exact Control Desk</h3>
	Dr. Moritsch from the Technical Museum in Vienna - now the home of the Mailuefterl computer - sent
	me some excellent pictures of the control desk of the Mailuefterl. With these photos I could make
	the layout of my control desk simulation much more like the original. In the next version, I plan
	to graphically visualize the switches and blinkenlights of the machine, to give a more authentic
	experience. Many thanks	go to Dr. Moritsch for his precious help.
	<p>
	I also continued the work on my Forth compiler for the Mailuefterl and added further kernel primitives.
	But all is still very much "work-in-progress".
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to get an impression of the new features.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>February 7, 2007: Mailuefterl Emulator now with Relay I/O</h3>
	I extended my Java Mailuefterl emulator by a simulation of the the relay I/O capabilities of the
	original machine. I also included an original program from 1960, which uses these features.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out this great old software.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>February 2, 2007: Mailuefterl Emulator</h3>
	The Mailuefterl was the first fully transistorized computer in Europe. It was built at the 
	Technical University of Vienna (Austria) from 1955 to 1958 by Dr. Heinz Zemanek and his team.
	I wrote an emulator for this pioneering machine as a Java applet.
	<p>
	Go to <a href="mailuefterl.html">my Mailuefterl page</a> to try out software which was
	written in the 1950ies and probably has not been run for almost 50 years now!

	<h3>May 4, 2006: Pacman Emulator for the Topfield TF4000PVR</h3>
	I wrote another emulator for the Topfield TF4000PVR digital satellite receiver: The
	famous game Pacman from 1980.
	<br>
	Go to my <a href="topfield.html">Topfield page</a> for more information and for the download.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>



	<h3>April 20, 2006: Space Invaders Emulator for the Topfield TF4000PVR</h3>
	I continued my programming efforts for the Topfield TF4000PVR digital satellite receiver and created
	an emulator for Space Invaders, the great classic arcade game from 1978.
	<br>
	Go to my <a href="topfield.html">Topfield page</a> for more information and for the download.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>



	<h3>April 16, 2006: Astro Fighter Emulator for the Topfield TF4000PVR</h3>
	I recently bought a digital satellite receiver, the great Topfield TF4000PVR. It is not the latest model
	but it offers a lot of features at a very low price. The Topfield can execute user-written
	plug-in programs, so-called TAPs (Topfield Application Programs). Of course, I immediately had to 
	try to create such a TAP, and I started with an Astro Fighter Emulator.
	<br>
	Go to my <a href="topfield.html">Topfield page</a> to read more about it and to download it.

	<h3>September 5, 2005: Asteroids in Java by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	After the first attempts with Tailgunner and Astro Fighter, I translated a real arcade classic to Java.
	It is Atari's great vector game Asteroids. Asteroids was originally written by Ed Logg of Atari Inc. in 1979,
	and it was the first arcade game I ever played (must have been back in 1980 :-).<br>
	My Java version was created twenty six years later by translating the program code,
	originally written for the 6502 CPU of the Asteroids machine, to Java.
	This translation was made by a Java program I wrote, which generates corresponding
	Java program code for each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques
	to the generated program (e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations).
	<br>
	This project is open source and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your
	PC or website and with the complete source code in Java.
	<br>
	Click <a href="sbt/Asteroids.html" target="_blank">here</a> to play Asteroids now.
	<br>
	Download the game from <a href="sbt/Asteroids.zip" target="_blank">here</a>, but please do not
	forget to credit Atari for the original game and me for translating it to Java :-)
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>



	<h3>August 28, 2005: Astro Fighter in Java by Static Binary Translation</h3>
	The arcade game Astro Fighter was originally written by Data East Corporation (DECO) in 1980.
	Twenty five years later, I made an internet browser version of it by translating the Astro Fighter
	program code, originally written for the 6502 CPU of the Astro Fighter machine, to Java.
	The translation was made by a program, which generates	corresponding Java program code for
	each 6502 instruction and applies some optimization techniques to the generated program
	(e.g., removal of redundant flag calculations).
	<br>
	This project is open source and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your

	<br>



	<h3>August 12, 2005: New Site Layout</h3>
	I made a new layout of my site. It uses frames now for the menu bar on the left-hand side, which
	makes navigation and maintainance easier.<br>
	In the last months I have been working on a static binary translator from 6502 machine language
	to Java and will present my first results soon. Stay tuned.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>July 19, 2004: Tailgunner in Java by Static Binary Recompilation</h3>
	Today is my birthday and I can present a new program here :-). It is an exact port of the 25 year old
	classic arcade game "Tailgunner". I did this little project together with Graham Toal.<br>
	Tailgunner is a nice vector game made by Dan Sunday of the company Vectorbeam in 1979. Vectorbeam and
	the game were sold to Cinematronics later. Tailgunner was very advanced for its time. It is probably
	the first 3D vector game (older than Battlezone). This time the exact reproduction of the game is not
	achieved by a conventional CPU emulator, but by so-called static binary recompilation.
	<a href="http://www.gtoal.com" target="_blank">Graham Toal</a> wrote a really cool program, which can
	translate the original game code from C-CPU machine language to C. With Graham's help I ported his generated
	code to Java and added the graphical Java environment to play the game in an applet.
	Thank you Graham, it was a cool project :-)
	<br>
	The program is open source, and you can download a zip file with the applet ready for installation on your
	PC or website and with the complete Java source code.

	<h3>March 7, 2004: MAME 0.80 with Mad Alien</h3>
	Today version 0.80 of <a href="http://www.mame.net"
	target="_blank">MAME</a>, the world's best arcade emulator, was released. It contains my driver for
	<a href="madalien.html" target="_blank">Mad Alien</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>February 26, 2004: Java Emulators Offline</h3>
	Today I removed my Java emulators from my website. I think after four years and more than 5 million
	visits most of the people, who are interested in this stuff, now know about JAE, ONE, and NOSE.
	Thanks to all of you for visiting and for your nice emails.
	The project is not dead. I will continue my work on them and will let you know about the news here.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>February 18, 2004: MAME Driver for Mad Alien</h3>
	I finished the preliminary version of my second MAME driver. It is for the still unemulated game
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="madalien.html" target="_blank">Mad Alien</a>
	</ul>
	made in 1980 by Data East Corporation (DECO).

	A cool Christmas present: Today version 0.78 of <a href="http://www.mame.net"
	target="_blank">MAME</a> was released, and it includes my
	<a href="supertnk.html" target="_blank">Super Tank</a> driver. Wow :-)<br>
	Merry Christmas to all the other MAME developers and to all the visitors of this site!
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>December 24, 2003: Super Tank on MAME WIP</h3>
	Today there was an update to the official <a href="http://www.mame.net/status.html"
	target="_blank">MAME WIP</a> site announcing my <a href="supertnk.html" target="_blank">Super Tank</a> driver.
	It reads: "Norbert Kehrer submitted a fully working driver for Super Tank".
	There are also 4 screenshots added. Nice to be on the official MAME WIP page :-) Thanks!
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>



	<h3>December 14, 2003: MAME Driver for Super Tank</h3>
	After so much Java emulation, I had to try something different and decided to make my first contribution to
	<a href="http://www.mame.net">MAME</a>.
	I wrote a driver for the still unemulated game
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="supertnk.html" target="_blank">Super Tank</a>
	</ul>
	The game was made in 1981 by the German company Video Games GmbH, and AFAIK it was licensed to Computran for
	the US market.
	<br>
	Go to <a href="supertnk.html">my Super Tank page</a> to read more about the game and the story of my driver for it.

	<h3>July 18, 2003: Star Trek and Tac/Scan</h3>
	Now almost a year has passed since the last news on this page. As tomorrow is my birthday,
	I wrote two new game drivers for the Java Arcade Emulator, to celebrate it and to show that
	emu programming is still big fun for me. Here are:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JStarTrek.html" target="_blank">Star Trek</a> and
		<li>
		<a href="JTacScan.html" target="_blank">Tac/Scan</a>
	</ul>
	These are two great vector games made by Sega in 1982. They are part of a series of vector
	games based on Sega's G80 hardware platform. More emulators of this series will follow soon.
	<br>
	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about these games and to play them online.

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>




	<h3>August 26, 2002: Red Baron</h3>
	Here is the next vector game for the Java Arcade Emulator:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JRedBaron.html" target="_blank">Red Baron</a>
	</ul>
	Atari made this 3D flight simulation game in 1980 and used almost the same hardware
	as for the Battlezone machine.
	<br>
	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about Red Baron and to play it online.

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>



	<h3>August 11, 2002: Battlezone</h3>
	After a long time, I am back with a new game for the Java Arcade Emulator (the 40th game).
	Is is Atari's cool vector game
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JBattleZone.html" target="_blank">Battlezone</a>
	</ul>
	In 1980 Atari's programmer Ed Rotberg created this excellent piece of software,
	which I think was the first realistic 3D simulation game.
	<br>
	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about the game and to play it online.

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>January 26, 2002: NOSE, the SMS emulator, is online</h3>
	After a lot of arcade game emulators, I had to try something (slightly) different. I wrote an emulator for the
	Sega Master System (SMS) in Java which lets you play SMS games in your browser. The new emulator is called
	<a href="nose.html">NOSE</a>, Norbert's Online Sega Master System Emulator :-) It is based on JAE and ONE and
	offers the following features:
	<ul>
		<li>
		emulation of the Z80 CPU of the SMS
		<li>
		emulation of the Sega Video Display Processor (similar to Texas Instruments' TMS9918/9928)
		<li>
		emulation of the SN76496 sound chip made by Texas Instruments and used in the SMS
	</ul>
	NOSE will be improved in later versions and more games will be added. For the moment, I have only uploaded
	one game, but it is THE game for the Sega Master System: <a href="nose.html">Sonic the Hedgehog</a><p>
	Go to the
	<a href="nose.html">NOSE page</a> to read more about it and to play "Sonic" online!

	<h3>January 13, 2002</h3>
	Another great arcade classic by Williams is playable in the Java Arcade Emulator. It is the bizarre
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JJoust.html" target="_blank">Joust</a>
	</ul>
	from 1982. Joust was a game with a really simple but absolutely brilliant game idea. It was a big 
	success in the arcades and appeared on almost all home systems.

	<h3>January 3, 2002</h3>
	A new game is available for the Java Arcade Emulator. It is the legendary
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JDefender.html" target="_blank">Defender</a>
	</ul>
	made by Williams in 1980. A real classic---one of the first arcade games I played, and one of the
	most thrilling.

	<h3>October 31, 2001</h3>
	At last, I had a little time to work on a game, that I have been trying to emulate in JAE for a long time.
	Now I succeded to solve most of the problems I had with it. It is the excellent arcade version of 
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JATetris.html" target="_blank">Tetris</a>
	</ul>
	made by Atari Games in 1988. Some nice additions to the classic game idea and a huge number of different levels
	make this Tetris version one of the most enjoyables.<br>
	The emulator does not perfectly emulate all of the graphics, because the Tetris machine used
	a dynamic color pallette. To compensate for this, a real-time emulation of Atari's famous "Pokey" sound chip
	was added, so that you can listen to the cool russian-style tunes, that Tetris plays with its two Pokey chips.
	<br>
	Go to the <a href="jae.html">JAE page</a> to read more about the game and to play Tetris online!


	<br>

	<h3>August 4, 2001</h3>
	And here is another game for the Java Arcade Emulator. Sega made a funny
	shooting game back in 1980, which is now emulated in JAE. It is
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JCarnival.html" target="_blank">Carnival</a>

	<h3>April 1, 2001</h3>
	Another great classic arcade game has been added to <a href="jae.html">JAE</a>, the Java Arcade Emulator.
	This time it is Taito's 1986 hit 
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JArkanoid.html" target="_blank">Arkanoid</a>
	</ul>
	The genre of wall and brick games was newly defined with Arkanoid. Cool features, attractive graphics,
	and brilliant gameplay made up the great success of this game.
	<br>
	The emulator supports sound by real emulation of the AY8910 sound chip, which was used in the Arkanoid machines.
	You can control the bat with the cursor keys or the mouse.

	<h3>March 28, 2001</h3>
	The last update of <a href="jae.html">JAE</a>, the Java Arcade Emulator, was made about half a year ago.
	At last I found some time to write a new driver. JAE now supports another one of the real classic games.
	It is Irem's arcade version of
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="JLdRun.html" target="_blank">Lode Runner</a>

	<h3>January 16, 2001</h3>
	After one year it was time for a new site design. Enjoy it.

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>January 14, 2001</h3>
	Version 1.2 of <a href="one.html">ONE</a>, the Online NES Emulator,
	has been released. This version has support for Nintendo's MMC3 chip (Mapper #4). Although not yet perfect,
	some games, which use the MMC3, have been added. For example
	<ul>
		<li>
		Super Mario Bros. 2,
		<li>
		Super Mario Bros. 3 (!), and 
		<li>
		Tecmo Super Bowl (greetings to Jasen Brooks and all American Football fans).
	</ul>
	Go to the
	<a href="one.html">ONE page</a> and play them online!

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h3>December 27, 2000</h3>
	Version 1.1 of
	<a href="one.html">ONE</a> has been released. It has the following new features:
	<ul>
		<li>
		A bugfix for pallette mirroring was made. Now the background colors are correct (blue sky in
		Super Mario Bros., a.s.o).
		<li>
		A GUI has been added. Now you can select the ROM from a list without having to reload the emulator.
		<li>
		More than 40 games can be played now.
	</ul>
	Go to the
	<a href="one.html">ONE page</a> to try the new version!
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>December 23, 2000</h3>

	<a href="one.html">ONE</a> has a great new logo now! JoseQ, the famous webmaster of 
	<a href="http://www.emuviews.com/" target = "_blank">JoseQ's EmuViews</a>, 
	has designed it.<br>
	Thanks a lot for the perfect work, JoseQ!
	<p>
	My homepage has reached more than 100,000 visits. Wow!!
	When I started the page about a year ago with the first version of JAE, with AstDX, and with Vantris,
	I never would have thought, that this would ever be possible.<br>
	So it is time to say a big "Thank You" to all my visitors, to the emulation news reporters, and to
	the other emulator authors.<p>
	Enjoy the software provided here and have a Merry Christmas! Frohe Weihnachten! Feliz Navidad! Buon Natale!

	<h3>December 17, 2000</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>
	A small bugfix for the
	<a href="one.html">Online NES Emulator (ONE)</a>
	has been made. Now the sound stops, when you close the browser window. Thanks to bwb for the bug
	report.<p>
	The next steps in ONE development will be a GUI and correct emulation of the background color.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>December 16, 2000</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>
	<a href="one.html">ONE</a>,
	the Online NES Emulator is out
	<p> 
	The Online NES Emulator (ONE) has been released today. It is a new NES emu written in
	Java (on the basis of JAE). ONE lets you play NES games online in your browser window. 
	At the moment there is support for the memory mappers 0, 1, 2, and 3. The number of mappers
	and supported games will increase soon. 
	ONE also has sound support. The sound is produced by real-time emulation of the NES Audio Processing
	Unit. As this had to be done in Java, the sound quality unfortunately is rather bad.<p>

	I made a little selection of games, which already are playable with ONE. You can try them at the
	<a href="one.html">ONE</a> page.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>November 18, 2000</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>
	There is a new addition to the Java Arcade Emulator. It is another Nintendo classic: 
	<a href="JMario.html" target = "_blank">Mario Bros.</a>
	This arcade game from 1983 was the starting point of the famous "Super Mario" series on the
	NES and	on the gameboy.
        Go to the
	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a>
        section to play it online.</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>November 4, 2000</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>
	I added a new game to JAE, the Java Arcade Emulator. There was already a rumor in 
	<a href="http://www.emuviews.com/" target = "_blank">JoseQ</a>'s
	famous Rumor Mill about this. It is
	<a href="JDKong3.html" target = "_blank">Donkey Kong 3</a>,
	Nintendo's third part of the Donkey Kong trilogy.
        Go to the
	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a>
        section to read more and to play it online.</li><p>

        <li>
	I also made my second sound chip emulator in Java. It emulates the AY-8910 sound generator, a
	chip used in many arcade games of the eighties. The AY-8910 was also used for
	<ul>
	<li><a href="JBagman.html" target = "_blank">Bagman</a> and
	<li><a href="JSBagman.html" target = "_blank">Super Bagman</a>,
	</ul>
	which now have sound in JAE.<br>
        Try these two classics and enjoy their funny tunes by clicking on the above links, or via the
	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a> section.</li>
	</ul>


	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>October 28, 2000</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
	I made the first really emulated sound for the Java Arcade Emulator. The Namco sound chip in
	<ul>
	<li><a href="JPacman.html" target = "_blank">Pacman</a>,
	<li><a href="JMsPacman.html" target = "_blank">Ms. Pacman</a>, and
	<li><a href="JPengo.html" target = "_blank">Pengo</a>
	</ul>
	has been emulated. This time this was not done by only playing pre-recorded samples of the game, but by 
	constructing the sound for the Namco 3-voice sound generator in real-time. The result is terrible, when compared
	to MAME (due to the limitations of standard Java). But maybe I can somehow improve the concept.<br>
	Another problem is, that sound does not stop, after closing the browser window with the game. For the moment
	you have to close the browser completely. I am working on this.<br>
	Big thanks go to
	Peter Futerko for the support with the sound routines.
	I used his great ideas, although I had to apply a completely different technique at the end, because I did
	not want to use the non-standard Java features of javax.sound.<br>
        Now try these three classics with sound in the
	<a href="jae.html">JAE</a> section!</li>
    </ul>


	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>October 11, 2000</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
