<h2>AstDX and Ast3DX</h2>



	<h3>AstDX, The Asteroids Emulator with New Graphics and Sound</h3>

	AstDX is an emulator for Atari's Asteroids arcade machine with newly designed
	graphics and sound. It uses Atari's program ROMs from 1979, but instead of drawing vector
	graphics as in the original game, all game objects are replaced by animated sprites.
	In the original arcade machine the sound is made with special
	circuits for each sound effect. In the emulator this is achieved with digital samples (.wav files).
	I added also a background music track with 10 different songs in MIDI format.<br>
	AstDX runs under DOS.

	Read more about AstDX in the <a href="astdx/astdx_readme.txt">readme file</a>.

	Look at an AstDX <a href="astdx/astdxdmp.gif">screen dump</a>.

	Download the program <a href="astdx/AstDX2.zip">AstDX2.zip</a> (1.2 MB).
	<p>
	Play AstDX under DOS with the MAME rom set for Asteroids.

	<h3>Ast3DX, The 3D Asteroids Emulator</h3>

	Ast3DX is an Asteroids emulator, which emulates Atari's Asteroids arcade machine,
	except that you play the game from the perspective of the cockpit of Asteroid's space ship.
	That means that Ast3DX is a first person 3D shooter with texture-mapped polygon objects, using
	the absolutely original Atari game play from 1979.<br>
	I added a background music track with 10 different songs from ABBA in MIDI format.<br>
	Ast3DX runs under DOS.
