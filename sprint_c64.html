<h2>Sprint 1 for the Commodore 64</h2>


In 1978 Atari's wholly-owned subsidiary Kee Games released the arcade game "Sprint 1". It was a one-player sequel
of the earlier two-player car-racing game "Sprint 2" from 1976. The machine was based on a 6502 microcprocessor.
<p>

I now ported that nice game to the Commodore 64 computer by just running the orignal arcade game program
on the C64. The arcade machine's video and sound hardware are emulated by specific C64 routines.
In the homecomputer version the game has to be played with the joystick instead of the original's steering, gearshift,
and accelerator pedal.

<p>
The game can be downloaded as a PRG file here: <a href="sprint_c64/sprint1.prg">sprint1.prg</a>

Below you see some screenshots of the running game:

Have fun!
